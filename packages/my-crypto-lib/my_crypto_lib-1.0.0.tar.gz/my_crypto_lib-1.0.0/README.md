Sure! Here's the updated `README.md` with additional code examples on how to access files and import modules within your `my_crypto_lib` package.

# My Crypto Library

My Crypto Library is a Python package that provides easy-to-use implementations of several classical ciphers, including Caesar Cipher, Playfair Cipher, Hill Cipher, and Vigenère Cipher. It is designed to be efficient, simple, and user-friendly.

## Installation

To install the library, you can either clone the repository or install it via pip:

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my_crypto_lib.git
cd my_crypto_lib
python setup.py install
```

### Install via pip (if uploaded to PyPI)
```bash
pip install my_crypto_lib
```

## Usage

### Importing the library

Once installed, you can import and use the ciphers from the library.

```python
# Import specific ciphers from the library
from my_crypto_lib.ciphers import caesar, playfair, hill, vigenere
```

### Accessing Files

The library files are organized in a directory structure. The main files include:

- `caesar.py`, `playfair.py`, `hill.py`, `vigenere.py` (each containing an implementation of a cipher).
- `info.py` (for library overview and details).
- `__init__.py` (marks the directories as Python packages).

#### Accessing Cipher Functions

Here’s how you can use the cipher functions in your Python code:

```python
# Example: Using the Caesar cipher
from my_crypto_lib.ciphers.caesar import encrypt, decrypt

# Encrypting a message
encrypted = encrypt("Hello World", 3)
print(f"Encrypted: {encrypted}")

# Decrypting a message
decrypted = decrypt(encrypted, 3)
print(f"Decrypted: {decrypted}")
```

#### Example: Using the Playfair Cipher

```python
from my_crypto_lib.ciphers.playfair import encrypt, decrypt

# Encrypting a message
encrypted = encrypt("Hello World", "KEYWORD")
print(f"Encrypted: {encrypted}")

# Decrypting a message
decrypted = decrypt(encrypted, "KEYWORD")
print(f"Decrypted: {decrypted}")
```

### Accessing the Library Overview

The library provides an easy way to view an overview of its structure and available modules by using the `info.py` file.

```python
# Example: Displaying library overview
from my_crypto_lib.info import library_overview

# Print library information
print(library_overview())
```

This will display details about the available ciphers and their usage in the library.

### File Descriptions:

- **caesar.py**: Implements the Caesar cipher.
- **playfair.py**: Implements the Playfair cipher.
- **hill.py**: Implements the Hill cipher.
- **vigenere.py**: Implements the Vigenère cipher.
- **info.py**: Provides information about the library and its modules.

### How to Access and Use Cipher Files

To use a specific cipher, simply import it from the appropriate file. For example:

- Caesar cipher: `from my_crypto_lib.ciphers.caesar import encrypt, decrypt`
- Playfair cipher: `from my_crypto_lib.ciphers.playfair import encrypt, decrypt`
- Hill cipher: `from my_crypto_lib.ciphers.hill import encrypt, decrypt`
- Vigenère cipher: `from my_crypto_lib.ciphers.vigenere import encrypt, decrypt`

You can also directly access the functions inside each module to perform encryption and decryption.

## Requirements

The library requires Python 3.x and the following dependencies:

- `numpy` (for Hill cipher matrix operations)
- `matplotlib` (optional, for visualizing encryption steps)

You can install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Explanation of Additions:
- **Importing modules**: I added a section showing how to import specific cipher modules.
- **Accessing files**: The README shows how to use functions directly from the files (e.g., importing `encrypt` and `decrypt` from `caesar.py`).
- **Library overview**: I added the `library_overview()` function usage from `info.py` for users to easily access a summary of the library.

This gives users a clear understanding of how to import, access, and use your library.
