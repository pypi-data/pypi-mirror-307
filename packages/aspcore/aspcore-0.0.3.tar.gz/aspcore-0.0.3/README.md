# ASPCORE : Audio Signal Processing Core
## Introduction
The package contains classes and functions implementing different versions of linear convolutions. What makes them useful above what's already available in scipy and numpy is that they are intended to be used in a streaming manner, where only parts of the input signal is available at a time. All filters support multiple inputs and multiple outputs. There is also support for convolution with a time-varying impulse response. 

The package uses just-in-time compilation from numba to achieve lower computational cost.

## Usage
The main function of this package is create_filter(). Using the keyword arguments, it will select and return the appropriate filter class. The filter can then be used to convolve using its process() method, which returns the filtered signal. 

Signals are formatted with the time index as the last axis, with most filters accepting signals of the form (num_channels, num_samples). Some filters accepts signals with higher dimensional channels, such as (a, b, c, ..., num_samples). 

```python
import numpy as np
import aspcore
rng = np.random.default_rng()

channels_in, channels_out, num_samples, ir_len = 5, 3, 128, 16

signal = rng.normal(0,1,size=(channels_in, num_samples))
ir = rng.normal(0,1,size=(channels_out, ir_len))

filt = aspcore.create_filter(ir=ir, sum_over_inputs=True)

filtered_signal = filt.process(signal)
```
