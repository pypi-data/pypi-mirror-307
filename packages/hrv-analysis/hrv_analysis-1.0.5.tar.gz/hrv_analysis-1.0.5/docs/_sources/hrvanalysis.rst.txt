API documentation
==================

Hrv-analysis consists of a single module which contains all relevant functions and algorithms.

Internally these functions are subdivided into 3 different modules :

- preprocessing

- extract_features

- plot

You should not need to import those modules directly unless you want access to some internal helper functions.
