Using the dough hook attachment, knead on medium speed for around 5 minutes or until the dough comes together. Add in one piece of butter and knead until incorporated. Then add the remaining two portions, kneading after each addition. Knead the dough for a further 10 minutes until silky and smooth."

Using a clean, dry mixer bowl and beating paddle, beat butter, icing sugar and salt on medium high speed for about 4-5 minutes, or until light, pale, and fluffy. With the mixer running, gradually add eggs, then mix until well combined, scraping down bowl as needed. Add the flour, then fold ingredients by hand using a spatula until well combined. Transfer the mixture to 1-litre (1 quart) heavy-duty zip-lock bag and snip 1 corner, making hole no larger than 1⁄4 inch (alternatively, transfer to pastry bag fitted with 1⁄4-inch piping tip). Set aside until ready to use (don’t put it in the fridge though!)."

Repeat with the other half of the dough. Working with 1 piece at a time, roll into a small ball first, then a flat round about 10cm (4”) in diameter. Use your rolling pin to make the edges of the circle thinner than the centre. Place a heaped teaspoon of the pork filling into the centre of the round. Pull the edges of dough to centre and pinch tightly to seal. Twist the dough and remove the knobbly bit from the top so that there isn’t any excess dough. Transfer bun to a tray lined with baking (parchment) paper, seam side down. Repeat with remaining dough pieces and remaining pork filling. Cover the buns with cling wrap and set aside to prove for 30 minutes."

Serve warm or at room temperature with chilli sauce and soy sauce on the side for dipping."
