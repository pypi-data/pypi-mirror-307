    "description": "Recipe video above. Ricotta pancakes are a step up from plain ones because they are extra soft and fluffy inside. Made famous by Australia&#39;s very own Bill Granger, a signature dish at his popular bistro Bills.Stove control is key, because these are thicker than standard pancakes. Heat too low, and the pancakes will be raw batter inside or won&#39;t rise enough. Too high, and the pancakes will burn before the inside is cooked. Aim for 3 minutes and golden brown surfaces. It&#39;s fine to go over (they will still be moist inside) but if you go under 2 1/2 minutes, they will be raw inside.9 - 10 pancakes (about 13cm/5&quot; in diameter).",

It’s fairly easy to make and I think the ricotta and eggs make them more filling and nutritious. My advice is not to deviate from the written recipe (Nagi knows what she’s doing!) and to be patient with cooking them. We will never go back to the flat, bland pancakes of the past!",
