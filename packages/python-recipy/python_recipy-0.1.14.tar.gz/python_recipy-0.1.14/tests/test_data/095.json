        "description": "Delicious and rich drink made with Assam and Darjeeling tea leaves and milk.  Add sugar or honey to enhance flavor. \n\nFor the complete recipe with step-by-step pictures: http://justonecookbook.com/recipes/royal-milk-tea/\n\nIngredients:\n\nTo make 1 cup\n3/4 cup water (Regular tea cup 80% full)\n2 heaping teaspoons (about 8 g) tea leaves*  \n1/2 cup milk (Regular tea cup 50% full)\nSugar or honey  (optional)\n\nTo make 2 cups\n1 cup warm water (Regular tea cup 100% full)\n3 heaping teaspoons (about 12 g) tea leaves*\n1 cup milk (Regular tea cup 100% full)\nSugar or honey  (optional)\n\nNOTE:\nTo make dark colored tea, use Assam tea and to make light colored tea, use Darjeeling tea.\n\nPlease note that the ratio for water is NOT double when you make 2 cups of royal milk tea. Water won't be evaporated as much so ¾ cup is right amount.\n\nIf you know how much sugar you like to add already, add sugar at the end before pouring into cup so sugar will be dissolved completely.\n\nTo make iced royal milk tea, you can cook the tea leaves a slightly little longer so ice will not dilute the flavor as much.\n\nMusic courtesy of Audio Network: \"Dark Bubble v2\"\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCheck out my blog: http://justonecookbook.com/\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n❀ Follow Just One Cookbook ❀\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/u/0/+NamikoChen/\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/justonecookbook\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/#!/justonecookbook\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/justonecookbook/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/justonecookbook\n------------------------------------------------------------------------",

Usually I started my day at the nearest Combini and bought a tamagosando and a Royal milk tea for breakfast on the go when I was going to that days exiting spot to explore. Here in Sweden Lipton isn't the brand  you think of when you think about quality tea... But their royal milk tea was the best! I wish I could get it here but no. Only one brand shows up in specialist asian shops and that one is good enough but not the same... ;) I make my own version at home to of course and just think back on my journey in Japan. I mostly use Earl Grey for this and I think it gives it an extra flavor. Next year I will go back, and this will probably be the first thing I buy when I land on Narita airport. :D",
