Turn off oven DO NOT OPEN DOOR.  Wait two hours and take out to carve. You should have a perfect rare/medium rare roast with the ends more done.  No need to let it rest.   If you have more guests requesting medium have a pan of ajus ready and dip in hot ajus as needed.    (Old Restaurant trick I learned at a steak house.",

            "reviewBody": "Though I agree with Mike G, the prior chef's comments about low and slow cooking, I think the reverse sear works far better then the initial 400 degree blast.  It also allows you to rest the roast before reheating the sear and this assures all the juices remain in the roast.  No need for second resting.  I also like the reverse sear because it easily allows you to adjust the dinner schedule without ruining the roast, a necessity in our very large family gathering.",

Once the internal temperature reaches 118° remove the roast and let it rest. This will stabilize the liquid and the first will continue to cook. Increase the oven temp to 500°. Once the internal temp of the resting roast reaches 125° return it to the hot oven for 5 to 7 minutes to get the desired crust.",

No fail, no anxiety, plenty of juice for gravy and Yorkshire pudding. Works over indirect wood or charcoal fire also if you cook roast in pan. Splurge, relax, enjoy!",
