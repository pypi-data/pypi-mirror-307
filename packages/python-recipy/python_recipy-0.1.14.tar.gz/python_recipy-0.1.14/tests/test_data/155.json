They're moist, fork tender and nicely seasoned.\r\nJust to change things up next time I might add heavy cream to the sauce to thicken it a bit...not because it needs it, but just to add some variety.\r\nI served this with shredded veggies: sauté 1 shallot in evoo/butter combo and add 1 yellow squash, 1 zucchini and 1 large carrot, all three shredded in my Cuisinart. season with salt &amp; pepper to taste. Yum! and very easy.\r\nDefinitely will do this again.",
