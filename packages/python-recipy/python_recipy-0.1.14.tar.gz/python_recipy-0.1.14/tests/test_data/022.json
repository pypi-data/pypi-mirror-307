The stew was bland and unpleasant to look at even though I followed the recipe (used water). I ended up removing all of the meat and just having a vegetable soup with a lamb broth. I added a bunch of flat leaf parsley and we are able to eat it. I went back to the website and saw what cut you used and went.... duh. I'm not sure what use these ragged stew meat chunks of fat and gristle are good for but I won't be buying them again."
