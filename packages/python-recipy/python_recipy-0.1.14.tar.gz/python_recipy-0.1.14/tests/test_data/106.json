    "description": "I was delighted to discover that this recipe was not only super easy, but also a tasty way to enjoy coffee in pudding form. With instant-tapioca, this pudding thickens readily and you may be tempted to eat it straight from the pan, but have patienceâ€”it&#39;s worth waiting for it to chill completely. Top with whipped cream for a sweet ending to a hot summer night.",
