    "description": "The cinnamon biscuit topping in this classic cobbler is easy to make, and easily adjustable. Reduce the buttermilk by 2 tablespoons for a crumblier, more streusel-like topping, or add 2 tablespoons to make it softer and cakelike. The cobbler can be made ahead and rewarmed: Tent it with foil and warm it in a 325-degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes.",

Also used all granny smiths rather than a mix or a sweeter variety. Excellent with whipped cream or vanilla bean ice cream",
