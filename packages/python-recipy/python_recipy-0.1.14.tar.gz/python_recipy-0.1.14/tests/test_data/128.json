I baked mine in an 8x8 glass pan, lowered the temp to 325F and cooked them for 45 mins and they were perfect. I will absolutely be making these the next time I need to bring a dessert to a get together!",

            "reviewBody": "Super delicious recipe! I love blondies, and have fond memories of eating them in years past. I'm lactose intolerant, so I did a bit of researching how to do brown butter, since my vegan butter substitute, Earth Balance, does not brown on its own (it will get brownish, but it won't get aromatic and nutty like real butter). This may sound strange, but I read you can add a bit of soy sauce (I added about a teaspoon) at the end of the butter melting process, and it adds the extra depth and color. I have to say that the flavor tasted weird in the butter, but once it all baked up, it tasted absolutely delicious. That said, I did not get the texture right. I could tell just in the mixing process that my batter was too stiff, and I'm not sure if that was from cooking the butter too long, overmixing, or what. It did not affect the finished product dramatically at all, but a little denser than I could see the pictures here were. Let me know if anyone else tries it - I'd love to hear how it went!",

What I thought was a sign that they were undercooked was actually proof that I hadn't really creamed the wet ingredients together thoroughly, so my butter sort of separated from everything. Wah-wah. But I'll try these again now that I know how to get them perfect the second time!",
