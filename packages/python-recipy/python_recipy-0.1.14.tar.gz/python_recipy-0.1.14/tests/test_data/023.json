As soon as they are all cooked through (you can tell because their color changes from a vibrant to a more dull green), start packing your canning jars with the peppers and onions, using a slotted spoon to remove them from the pan. Pack the jars evenly with the peppers and onions, up to about 1 inch from the top of the jars. Then pour the brine over the peppers, until it covers them. Leave about 1/2 inch headspace between the tops of the pickles and the rims of the jars."

Remove jars from the pot using tongs or jar lifters. If you live over 1,000 feet above sea level, adjust your processing time using the directions here .
