My husband caught me putting the eggs in the oven, made a funny face and said \"What Are You Doing?!!!\" He wasn't very happy that I was \"wasting\" our eggs trying this. He LOVED them!!!! He ate most of the eggs himself. I did modify the recipe slightly buy sautéing some onions and garlic and tossing them in with the batter, and adding cheese when almost done. Will definitely make over and over again!"

It was almost too much (not it wasn’t, barely) but we like to add salt on top and definitely could not. It took WAY longer in a 9x13 so I kicked it up to 375* for a jaunt then back down. I stirred more than once because it was taking so long boot watch because it will sincerely be perfect! **Remember not to just stir but scrape along the bottom and sides amen stirring. I’d consider splitting it between two pans not they turned out so perfectly I’ll just plan for more time! Added cheese on top to melt. Yum! These were delicious, fluffy texture, perfect moistness, not crumbly, not dry, not like a bad batch of camp or buffet eggs. They are the perfect scrambled egg but easier for a big crowd (or for a small crowd and left overs)! Thanks for a great recipe!",

Some came back for seconds or even thirds! One boy said they were better than his grandma's, which I assume was high praise. Personally I could have done with a little less salt, but it wasn't bad at all. They took a bit longer to cook than expected. I was running short on time by the second batch, so I bumped the temperature up to 400°, which had the second batch done in the expected time frame. I sprinkled shredded Colby Jack cheese on one batch for the last 5 minutes. Overall = easy and YUM!",

I made a few adjustments to cater to what I had available and to keep it on the healthier side. Here's my modified version: Reduced the original recipe, using 12 eggs for a half-sized batch. Substituted milk with two tablespoons of powdered milk dissolved in one glass of water, mixed with a handheld frother. Seasoned with a generous amount of granular/ground pepper, around 6 shakes of garlic salt, 3-4 shakes of paprika, and replaced butter with 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil. Prepared a shallow glass baking pan (2.375'' H x 10'' L x 15'' W) by brushing it with an additional 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil. Whisked all the ingredients thoroughly to ensure a smooth mixture. Baked for 10 minutes at 350 degrees, adjusting the time due to my altered recipe and using a gas oven in New York (considering variations based on location and elevation). After the initial 10 minutes, I found it still a bit soupy, so I turned the eggs with a spatula and returned them to the oven for another 10 minutes. At this point, it became bubbly, and I repeated the process of turning the eggs and baking for an additional 5 minutes. Once done, I let the eggs cool on the stove to allow them to thicken further. The result was wonderfully fluffy and delicious eggs, perfect for my week's meal prep. I paired them with baked bacon for a quick and easy reheat, serving them alongside a bagel or toast. Happy cooking!",
