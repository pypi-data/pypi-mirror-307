The cake was burning on the sides but liquidy in the middle. took it out after 35 mins. The icing was a complete failure with shards of hard caramel in the frosting. Also I burnt myself quite badly on the caramel. All in all a disaster for me.",

I cut the sugar in the cake by at least half.  I also do a different frosting that doesn't use candies; the one I use is from Sally's Baking Addiction",

Second time, I reduced batter sugar by 1/3 and frosting sugar by a whole cup (and butter to 1 stick) and I think it’s SO much better - the apples just sing in the cake and the caramel flavor comes through beautifully in the frosting.
