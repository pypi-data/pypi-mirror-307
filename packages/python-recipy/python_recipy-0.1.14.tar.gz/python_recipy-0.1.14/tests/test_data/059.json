    "description": "The RICE PILAF in this recipe is sensational. Tastes savoury but with a touch of apple sweetness, herby fragrance, combined with plump cranberries, warm crunch of walnuts, and with fresh apple providing a fabulous finishing touch. The chicken is sticky from the jam (great shortcut trick) and savoury from the seasoning spices. The key step that makes a real difference is \"oven sautéing\" onion and garlic first. Festive inspired midweek meal to have all year round! Recipe VIDEO below.",

I only put 3 pieces of chicken in one casserole dish with the rice and the other 5 pieces of chicken in another casserole dish. The chicken turned out good but the rice was a little al dente. I think that I should have used a measuring cup instead of the rice measuring cup that came with my rice cooker.\r\n\r\nI still like my dinner but next time, I will remember about the measuring cup.",
