This was so easy and great to portion out for quick meals later. Thanks Beth for the great vegan recipe!",

For those who can't find or can't eat yeast, I think these would also work: some miso at the end or (the most Italian option) 2 or 3 anchovy fillets that get sauteed with the garlic until they form a paste. Dried porcini would also be good but they are more expensive, and they would lend a mushroomy flavor (delicious especially with oregano, thyme and rosemary).",

The pureed cannellini beans is a shear genius  addition; and the soup does not taste beany.  It makes it so thick and \"bisque-like\" while not adding dairy or fattening cream.  My BF scarfed 2 big bowls before he even finished his boca burger (It's meatless Saturday.... and he loves bocas).  So tasty and satisfying.  I did up the yeast b/c I love that stuff.\r\n\r\nI just wish I'd made a double batch. However it's so easy and non labor intensive, no big deal to make more.  Thanks for this!",

I used an inexpensive 2.5kg (5.5 lbs) catering tin of cherry tomatoes and scaled up the recipe, increasing the herbs a bit (no nutritional yeast) and putting grated padano cheese on the table. The beans were a mix of borlotti and cannellini. Cost wise, it came in at 42 pence ($0.58 US) per portion of 2 ladlefuls. The base mix of tomatoes and pureed beans could be adapted to other flavours too e.g. fajita spice mix, curry mix, lemon &amp; tarragon, smoked paprika/chipotle, or bulked out with cooked pasta for a minestrone...",
