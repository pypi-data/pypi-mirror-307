    "description": "Palmiers are some of my favorite cookies. I&#39;d always thought of them as the perfect combination of flaky pastry dough and crisp cookies mixed with just the right amount of caramelized sugar. But this recipe for Cardamom Caramel Palmiers from Chewy Gooey Crispy Crunchy Melt-in-Your-Mouth Cookies by Alice Medrich took these cookies to the next level by mixing in aromatic cardamom and a pinch of salt.",

Likewise, fold the other end of the dough toward the center 3 times, leaving a tiny space at the center. The dough should now resemble a tall, narrow open book.

Return the sheets to the oven and bake for another 3 to 5 minutes, until the cookies are deep golden brown. Rotate the pans and watch the cookies carefully at this stage to prevent burning. If the cookies brown at different rates, remove the dark ones and let the lighter ones continue to bake. For lined pans, set the pans or just the liners on racks to cool; for unlined pans, use a metal spatula to transfer the cookies to racks. Making sure the cookie sheets are completely cool, repeat with the second piece of dough. Cool the cookies completely before storing. May be kept in an airtight container for up to 4 days."

I like cardamom a lot, I think I will add a bit more to the sugar for the second batch of dough, and maybe add some orange zest.\n\n@jessjess - you could certainly use a different spice, I think cinnamon would be very good. Or leave out the spice all together and just use the sugar."
