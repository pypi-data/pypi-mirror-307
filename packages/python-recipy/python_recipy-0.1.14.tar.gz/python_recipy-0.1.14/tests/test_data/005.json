I don't enjoy pork and ate 2 pieces so this will definitely be made again. \n\nI didn't have 2 cups of cherries (only about 1 cup so I went with it). I also served it with a side of grilled fresh green beans (in a grill basket about 4 minutes depending on size of green beans-toss in EVOO, grill then put in the same bowl you tossed and add a seasoning of your choice).",

Used 1T red wine and 1T bourbon just for fun - I don't think that mattered. My family loves cherries - so this is a keeper for us.",

And after it was plated, it looked beautiful like we were impressing company but it was just the two of us. \n\nThe Chipotle seasoning on the tenderloin is what initially drew me to this recipe. My husband loves to grill tenderloin and serve it with sauces made with wonderful chiles used in New Mexican cooking. I love those flavors as well but many of them are much too spicy for me born and raised in Minnesota. The Chipotle was in fact more mild than I expected. The basil seem strange but I made it exactly as noted and the flavor was new and unexpected in a great way.",
