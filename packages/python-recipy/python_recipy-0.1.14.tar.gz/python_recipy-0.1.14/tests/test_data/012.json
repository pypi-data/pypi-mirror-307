Pour the hot oil and aromatics over the potato slivers, toss. Pour on the sesame oil and retoss.

Notable, because there are so many half-ass recipes everywhere that don't don't turn out the way it's supposed-to because people don't seem to care enough to actually test the directions with a 3rd-party who won't assume many things that the recipe originator did.  Or mix up their units, etc.\r\n\r\nThis recipe works and it is delicious.  I would only suggest a variation in which Asian black vinegar (I'm sure the many different varieties out there are all valid for their individual spins; I used Kong Yen, a Taiwanese black vinegar) is supplemented near the end for extra depth-of-flavor.\r\n\r\nGreat work, folks.  Will be checking this site for more recipes.",
