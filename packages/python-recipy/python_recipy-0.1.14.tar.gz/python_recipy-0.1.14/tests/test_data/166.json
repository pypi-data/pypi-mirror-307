    "description": "Adapted from Classic German Baking by Luisa Weiss I used a mix of apples, some tart, some less-so. Do use good-quality, flavorful apples, preferably ones from a farmers&#39; market, which taste better than supermarket varieties. For suggestions on which apples to use, ask the people at the farm stand or choose those that have a fragrance. Apples are related to roses, so often have a faint, yet lovely, rosy smell. If your apples are small, use 6 of them. Luisa recommends grating the almond paste, which I didn&#39;t do, so I had to run the mixture through a food processor. Since my almond paste was &quot;artisanal&quot; it wasn&#39;t as moist as what you buy at the grocery story, so that may have been the culprit. So I recommend grating the almond paste in step #4.",
