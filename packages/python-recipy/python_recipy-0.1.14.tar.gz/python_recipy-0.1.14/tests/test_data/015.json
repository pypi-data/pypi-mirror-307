    "description": "If you like, fry the chicken hours in advance and reheat on a rack in a 375F oven until warm. This excellent karaage recipe from Love Japan (2023, Ten Speed Press) is simple, crunchy, and loaded with balanced flavor. This recipe was slightly adapted from the book written by Sawako Okochi and Aaron Israel with Gabriella Gershenson. If serving as a main course, one batch would satisfy four people.",
