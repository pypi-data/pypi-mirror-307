I live at high altitude (7200 ft) so I reduced the baking powder to 2 1/2 teaspoons and also made it with almond milk, but followed the rest of the recipe to a T and they turned out nice and tall. I didn’t have muffin liners on hand, so just greased the pan and they came out perfect. Thanks for sharing! ",

They are just the right amount of sweet, like a good quality scone, the berries give an extra punch of flavor, and the oatmeal gives good texture. I doubled the cinnamon in the batter just on a hunch, and it seemed like a good move. I also didn't have muffin liners, so I just sprayed the pan good and baked them \"naked\" and that worked fine. Less garbage anyways. Made exactly 9 muffins full to the brim and I ate 2 right out of the oven with some butter. Mmm.",
