I decided to give them a try and the kids and I loved them! I filled them with tuna salad and chicken salad, wrapped a small piece of nori at the bottom and sprinkled the tops with vegetable furikake. They were delicious and my daughter who is a picky eater at 2 at lunch and then wanted them for dinner too! Definitely a hit and will make again!!",
