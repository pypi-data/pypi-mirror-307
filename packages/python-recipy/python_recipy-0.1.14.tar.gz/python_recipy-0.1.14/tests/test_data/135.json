    "name": "Hunan Lamb skewers",
    "description": "These Hunan lamb skewers are inspired by the flavours found in food from the area of Hunan in China. They’re deliciously tender and juicy on the inside but have a crusty exterior that makes your mouth water at the mere mention of them. And that chilli salt sprinkle? The finishing touch you never knew you needed.",
