Add more breadcrumbs if necessary to get the mixture to hold its shape when rolled. Heat a little bit of olive oil in a large non-stick or heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat. Add the meatballs in batches and turn every few minutes until the exterior is golden brown and the inside is fully cooked.",

You can do the sauce hot or cold, and you can compliment it with a bright and herby finish like chimichurri or just a little extra lemon juice, salt, pepper, and Parmesan. If you do the sauce hot, I recommend simmering it first with a little bit of additional liquid to help it loosen up.",

The only drawback to the recipe was that everyone was back in the kitchen an hour later looking for more food!  We split the recipe between 5 people, I served more veggies on the side but everyone was still starving an hour later!  Not sure this recipe would stretch to 8 people as it's not very filling?  Will definitely make again though, thanks."
