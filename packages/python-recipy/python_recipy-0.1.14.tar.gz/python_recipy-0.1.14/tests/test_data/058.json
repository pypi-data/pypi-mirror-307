    "description": "This is a copycat of a Japanese Slaw sold at a charcoal chicken chain called Chargrill Charlie&#39;s here in Sydney. This slaw-like salad has a Japanese spin with a scattering of edamame, sesame-dressed wakame seaweed salad and a creamy soy dressing. The seaweed totally makes it!Serve it as a side or as a meal with a simple piece of Asian Glazed Salmon or Honey Garlic Chicken Breast.",
