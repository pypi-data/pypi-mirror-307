It comes together pretty quickly, especially if you cook the peas in the Instant Pot, and the flavors are just incredible. Definitely one of those sneaky and satisfying vegetarian dishes where carnivores won't miss the meat one bit. It has even converted my hubby who used to \"hate\" black-eyed peas. We typically make the recipe exactly as written except for the habanero, as our Berbere mix (from Whole Foods) is quite spicy. A splash of lime and a dollop of yogurt are nice as toppings.",

After 5 mins I add the black eyed peas and water and stock let that boil and them simmer (I pre-soaked the beans overnight)\nMeanwhile I sliced and roasted an eggplant in the oven (for about 20 mins or so until the slices where brown but still soft).\nThen I added the tomatoes and other spices, and let simmer another 5 mins - then added the roasted eggplant.\nAfter that I added about 100g of spinach - just to have even more iron in this dish.\nI added the coconut a little more toward the end. \nFor serving along with the cilantro, I had the option for freshly squeezed lime juice, which gave it a great zest. It was a wonderful dish. Thanks very much. I am keeping this one in my recipe book!",
