I was taught how to make an egg cream by someone who’d been making them his whole long life, and I subsequently made thousands of egg creams, and once you’ve made it this way you’ll realize how wrong these alternative approaches are. \n\nYou DON’T mix the syrup in right off the bat. You add the WHOLE MILK first, THEN the seltzer, which creates a beautiful white head of foam. THEN you squirt the syrup THROUGH THE WHITE FOAM and then stir with a long fountain (or bar) spoon (which has a very thin handle) taking great care to mix the seltzer/milk/syrup without disturbing the white foam. THAT’S how you get that beautiful white head atop the chocolate."

The flavor is about as far removed from chocolate as I think a product can get before simply being called \"chocolate-colored sugar syrup.\" Despite being untraditional, I think even Hershey's syrup (or, better yet, Hershey's Special Dark syrup) would bring an egg cream a lot closer to being identifiable as chocolate."

For present day this is 99% going to be closest to what was or at least what is outside of New York, they still have those old school seltzer that dispensers. Follow this true recipe and your heart will be singing for more."
