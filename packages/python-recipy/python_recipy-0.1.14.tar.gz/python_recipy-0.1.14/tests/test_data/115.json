    "description": "Bánh Cam or Bánh Rán is a Vietnamese dessert of deep-fried glutinous rice ball with a sesame seed crust and a sweet mung bean paste filling. The shell is crunchy with a chewy texture and the interior is hollow. Sometimes you can find these treats coated in a thin crust of caramel sugar. It’s crunchy, chewy, and semi-sweet. It’s delicious as a healthy snack or a quick sweet breakfast on the go. This makes 24 balls.",

    "recipeIngredient": [
        "1½ cups dried peeled split mung beans",
        "1 cup granulated sugar",
        "¼ teaspoon salt",
        "1 tablespoon vegetable oil",
        "1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut",
        "1 bag glutinous rice flour (16 oz)",
        "3 tablespoons rice flour",
        "⅓ cup potato starch",
        "2 teaspoons baking powder",
        "1½ cups hot water",
        "1¼ cups granulated sugar",
        "1 tablespoon vegetable oil and more for deep-frying",
        "1 cup sesame seeds"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "For the filling, rinse the mung beans in a colander until water runs clear. Transfer mung beans to a medium-size pot and add water to cover by 3 inches. Bring the pot to a boil then reduce heat to a low simmer. Partially cover with a lid. Cook for about 1 hour or until you can easily smash a mung bean between your fingers. Once you reach this point, continue to cook on low heat, uncovered, to let the excess water evaporate off. No standing water should be in the pot.",
        "Add sugar, salt, vegetable oil, and shredded coconut to the mung beans. Mix and mash the mung beans until you get a homogenous paste. Divide the mung bean into 24 golf-size balls (about 1-inch in diameter).",
        "In a large bowl, whisk together glutinous rice flour, regular rice flour, potato starch and baking powder until evenly combined.",
        "Add water, sugar, and vegetable oil and kneed until you get a smooth, slightly sticky but manageable, ball of dough.",
        "Divide the dough into 24 balls (a tad bigger than the mung bean filling, about 1-½ inches in diameter). Flatten the dough and place the filling ball in the center. Pull the sides to the top and pinch together the seams. Roll the ball back and forth in the palm of your hands until the seams are no longer visible. Roll the ball in sesame seeds to cover.",
        "Fill a large wok or pot with 3 inches of vegetable oil and heat the oil until it reaches 350°F. Deep fry in batches if needed. Use a slotted spoon to lower the balls into the oil. Let it sit in the oil for 5 seconds then swoosh them around so that it cooks up round. Cook for 6-8 minutes then transfer them to a wire rack to remove excess oil. Leftovers keep well in the freezer for up to 3 months. To reheat, pop them in the microwave, toaster oven or refry them in oil."
