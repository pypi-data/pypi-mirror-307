    "description": "Recipe video above. Are you ready to discover the world&#39;s easiest curry?? As in, a real one, made from scratch. Introducing - Kuku Paka! This chicken curry in a tomato coconut spiced sauce tastes like an Indian curry. Except it&#39;s African, and you can get everything you need from your regular grocery store. For a strictly traditional version, sear the chicken over charcoal for chargrilled flavour before adding into the sauce. To make this Monday-night-friendly, I&#39;ve just pan-seared. Serves 4 hearty appetites or 5 to 6 regular servings.",

When I was in south and east Africa a few years ago, I ate a number of â€˜curryâ€™ dishes and quickly learned kuku was chicken and beef was usually zebu. In areas with a British/Indian heritage, I heard the word â€˜pukkaâ€™ (meaning real or good) a lot and Iâ€™m wondering whether this word may be the origin of paka? Just a thought.\r\n I love this recipe anyway, reminds me of the tastes of my visit. Any info on an original recipe Rimu?\r\nThanks Nagi, itâ€™s one of my favourites! Love your work!!",
