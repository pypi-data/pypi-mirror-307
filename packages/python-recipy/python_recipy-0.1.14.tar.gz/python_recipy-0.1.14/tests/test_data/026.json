However, prep time is definitely not under five minutes. \nScrubbing and cutting the potatoes easily takes fifteen minutes. I'm not complaining about the time it takes, but I think it's a bit misleading to say prep time is under five minutes.",

The potatoes that were in contact with the sides of the slow cooker got crispy, and the ones in the middle were soft. Both were amazing and delicious! I'm making this a second time right now!",
