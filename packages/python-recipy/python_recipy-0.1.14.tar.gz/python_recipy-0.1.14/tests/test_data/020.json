I also used a mix of white/concord grape juice, but otherwise didn't alter ingredients at all. I cooked on low for 4 hours, then turned it off and let it sit for another 2 hours before serving. The pork was cooked through and soft, though I don't think quite soft enough to shred. The sweet potatoes were very, very soft -- to the point where they fell apart when you tried to pick them up with the fork. The carrots and onions were just right. Taste-wise, it wasn't bad -- just bland. It desperately needs some other spices to give it some oomph, but sadly, I'm not good at figuring out what seasonings taste good with what ingredients, so I can't really offer any suggestions. I wouldn't make this again unless there were some 5 star ratings from people who listed the spices/quantities they used to perk it up.",
