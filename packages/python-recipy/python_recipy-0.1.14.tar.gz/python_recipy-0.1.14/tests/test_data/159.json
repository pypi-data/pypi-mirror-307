Place chicken in pan, breast side up, and cook until skin is brown, 6–8 minutes. Tip pan to one side to gather accumulated fat and juices and baste top of chicken. Return pan to oven and cook chicken until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the deepest part of the thigh registers 165°, 50–55 minutes. Transfer chicken to a carving board, rub with garlic halves, and let rest for at least 10 minutes before carving. Pour off fat and juices from skillet, leaving browned bits in pan; set skillet aside."

Place carrots on a rimmed baking sheet in a single layer and bake until bottoms of carrots are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Stir and cook until carrots are tender and brown, about 5 minutes longer."

Pour in parsley oil and cook, scraping up browned bits from bottom of pan, until heated through. Add 1 Tbsp. lemon juice and swirl pan to mix. Season sauce to taste with salt and more lemon juice, if desired. Serve warm parsley sauce alongside roast chicken and carrots."
