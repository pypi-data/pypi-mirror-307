I made my bowl with brown rice and it didn’t “clump” as well I’m sure jasmine rice would have but it was still delicious and crispy. I had a fennel bulb which I sliced thin and roasted in gochujang butter and added it to the salad along with crispy baby lettuce. The dressing is absolutely bananas. Fish sauce in abundance can put me off so I made mine with just one Tbs. It was perfect for me. Thanks for a creative and delicious salad!"
