The last time I made them, however, on a whim I left out the Cumin altogether and substituted Cardamom in it's place. Best substitution ever! So if you're not really a big fan of Cumin, try putting Cardamom instead. But either way, this is a great recipe!<br />**I do not pre-toast the nuts in the pan (first part of step 3) but follow the stove top directions otherwise. After turning them out onto the parchment lined sheet pan, I put them in the oven to toast and dry out (stirring occasionally). I read reviews where some people's pecans did not dry all the way when just cooking them in the pan, so this is an easy modification if you have that issue.<br />"

After toasting the pecans in the oven, put all the nuts in a large high sided skillet, over low medium heat. 3. Put the seasoned sugars in with the nuts, stirring to evenly coat and then finally added the water to help dissolve the sugars. Keep stirring until you are happy with the distribution of sugars and spice over the nuts. Made 6 batches this way and every single person was delighted!"

Genius spice combination, balanced beautifully with the sugar blend as well the flavor and texture of the butter over the toasted pecans (do yourself a favor and use a high end butter like unsalted Kerrygold).  We made several pounds throughout the holidays, gave away much of what we made to friends and family as gifts, and everyone raved.  Also did a batch of mixed nuts this way, and they were good, but pecans are definitely the best backdrop for this recipe.  We also made some for a vegan friend using a vegan margarine in place of the butter, and even those were surprisingly good.  We think these are much more satisfying than the often hyped \"Union Square Cafe Bar Nuts\" which are much more salty and have a one dimensional flavor profile by comparison.  These magical spiced pecans will definitely be a new holiday tradition in our family for years to come.  Thanks Alton!"

Firstly, I only used light brown sugar.  Also, I didn't have any dried zest so I made my own by zesting one orange which I then put in between 2 paper towels and microwaved 4 minutes at 40% power which did the trick.  After sampling my efforts and immediately made another batch thinking these would make a great hostess gift.  One problem,  I can't stop eating them!  They're so addictive!!  The spicing is perfect.  They're great on their own but would be equally wonderful in a salad.  I may get adventurous next time and add freshly chopped rosemary.  This recipe is definitely getting added to my repertoire of holiday foods.  Bravo Alton!"

That said, I will probably cut back a little on the cayenne, too, since I think the cumin helps \"cut\" the cayenne.  The cayenne as it is in the recipe as written is very subtle...tastes \"warm\", not \"hot\".

With the 2nd batch I used 1t of all spices keeping the salt at 1t as well. Still very good, just a bit stronger of flavor and heat. I mixed both batches together.

My pecans were kind of sticky after they cooled and I remembered that humidity can mess with candy recipes (like Alton, I live in the humid South, so I heated the oven to 175 degrees, put the whole pan in the oven and checked it every 20 minutes or so until all the stickiness was gone."

I omitted the orange on one since I did not have it.  Have tried since with orange zest - get a little orange flavor, none - doesn't hurt the flavor, 2 tablespoons of orange juice - just a hint of flavor... Most of the butter and sugar stay in the pan but you can cut back on all of it to suit to taste.  Increase the cayenne, decrease the cayenne, same for the cumin.  It really is up to you on how you want them to taste at the end.  But as is, followed to the letter, is yummy too. Oh, and you can skip the parchment as well.  One note, when you add the seasonings, don't stand directly over the pan!  Also, you can use all light brown or all dark brown sugar too."

They're just right, not too sweet, not too salty.  I can't really taste the orange zest and like another reviewer I also thought the cumin would overwhelm everything else (judging by the smell but that was not true.

            "reviewBody": "These nuts are wonderfully easy to make - one adjustment I made was to lay the nuts out on a cookie sheet and toast them in the oven instead of in the skillet on the stove. I think they toasted more evenly that way. While they toasted I melted the butter in the skillet and got all the other ingredients measured and ready. Finished the preparation as directed and they are great.  I made 4 batches one after another and have filled gift jars for the holidays with very little work or mess. Definitely a keeper."

We like things spicy here in Louisiana, so I increased the amount of cayenne to our tastes.  This will make a great snack for an upcoming BBQ Shower and as gifts this Christmas.  This recipe will be a keeper in our household. "

I made both the regular recipe using Brown Sugar and spices, only addition, I placed baking sheet with cooked pecan mixture in oven preheated to 250 degrees (turned off overnight    It gave them a crisp light texture.  Trying to find a Sugar Free sweet pecan recipe, I used my new favorite Alton Brown's Spicy Pecans recipe , substituting 1/4 c Splenda Brown Sugar for Brown Sugar in recipe. It is fabulous!  Again, I placed the cooked nuts on baking sheet in oven that had been preheated to 250 (turned off to dry out.  Good luck to ya! <br /> "
