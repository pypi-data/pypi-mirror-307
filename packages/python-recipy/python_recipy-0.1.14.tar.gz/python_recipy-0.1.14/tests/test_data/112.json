    "recipeIngredient": [
        "3 lbs beef (boneless beef chuck, see notes)",
        "1 teaspoon red curry powder",
        "1 teaspoon sea salt",
        "1 tablespoon granulated cane sugar",
        "1 tablespoon chicken bouillon powder (optional)",
        "1 teaspoon MSG (optional)",
        "2 tablespoons minced garlic",
        "2 tablespoons minced shallots",
        "1 lb carrots (3 whole)",
        "2 large stalks fresh lemongrass",
        "2-inch knob ginger",
        "2 tablespoons vegetable oil or annatto oil",
        "2 tablespoons tomato paste",
        "12 oz coconut soda or juice (1 can)",
        "5 cups water",
        "1 Chinese cinnamon stick (cassia bark)",
        "3 whole star anise",
        "1 tablespoon fish sauce",
        "½ tablespoon light soy sauce",
        "Cilantro",
        "Thai Basil",
        "¼ teaspoon ground black pepper",
        "½ teaspoon salt",
        "2 teaspoons fresh lime juice"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Cut away excess fat from the beef chuck then slice beef into 1\" to 1-½” cubes. Peel the carrots and cut them into the same size chunks as the beef. Discard the lemongrass leafy tops, if any. Cut the lemongrass stalk into 4\" segments. Smash the stalks with a mallet or something heavy to release their aroma and flavor. Slice the ginger into thick coins and give each coin a gentle smash.",
        "Add beef cubes to a medium bowl and marinate with red curry powder, salt, sugar, chicken bouillon powder, MSG, garlic, and shallots for at least 30 minutes, or overnight in the fridge for better results.",
        "To the bottom of a large pot with a lid, add oil and heat on medium-high. Add beef. Pan fry until you get color on all sides (about 5 minutes). Clear the center. Add the lemongrass and ginger slices. Pan fry for about one minute.",
        "Stir in tomato paste. Add coconut soda, and water. Braise with the lid on for 1-½ hours on low heat.",
        "Add carrots, cinnamon stick and whole star anise. Continue cooking with a covered lid on a low simmer until carrots are chopstick-tender (about more 30 minutes). If the liquid is evaporating off too much, add a bit more water. Discard the lemongrass, ginger slices, cinnamon stick and star anise.",
        "Season broth to taste with a bit of fish sauce and light soy sauce.",
        "When ready to serve, garnish with cilantro or Thai basil.",
        "Make the optional dipping sauce by mixing together lime/lemon juice, ground black pepper and salt and serve with a toasted French baguette, or steamed white rice. If making this with rice noodles, add a bit more hot water to the stew to make it soupier. Season the broth with additional fish sauce and soy sauce, if needed."
