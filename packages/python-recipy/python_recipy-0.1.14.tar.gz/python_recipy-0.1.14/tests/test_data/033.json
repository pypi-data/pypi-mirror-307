There's no mention of the cavity. The cavity needs SOMETHING in it. It's a giant hole that makes a big difference in cooking times. Typically, the recommendation here is a broken or crushed stick of cinnamon, a halved apple, a quartered onion, and some choice herbs like sage, rosemary, and thyme. The master chef recommends some heating in the microwave to get the flavors started. Use a little water(or insert liquid) in the bottom of dish to help steam heat.¬†"

The turkey had such wonderful flavor and was so juicy! This is my go to recipe and I can't wait for next month to do this again. I bet this would be perfect with regular chicken and without it being a holiday as well. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! "

I figured with the brining and the cooking method, there was no way I could mess this up! Let me tell you, this was hands down the best turkey I've eaten in my life. It was flavorful - not one flavor overpowered the other - and it was the juiciest turkey I've ever had the pleasure of eating. I was cooking for a small group so I had a 10 pound turkey, it was done cooking after 1.5 hours and we let it rest for 30-45 minutes before carving. The brining really shortens the cook time so be aware! I followed the recipe almost exactly (I don't have a fancy probing thermometer!) and I will <b>always </b>use this exact recipe. It was amazing and my very first turkey was a huge success!¬†<div><br /></div><div>Thank you Alton Brown, you've never done me wrong!</div>"
