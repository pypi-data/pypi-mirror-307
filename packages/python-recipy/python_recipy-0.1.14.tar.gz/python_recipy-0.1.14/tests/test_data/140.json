To make it much easier to eat I peeled/de veined the shrimp. Then add heads/shells to a small amount of boiling water to make a rich shrimp stock. I mix the shrimp stock with the chicken stock 50/50.\r\n2. As I used more shrimp, I doubled the sauce quantity as I needed to add additional sauce to the original to keep it moist and delicious.\r\n3. I used a little less ginger but minced so as not to have to remove the ginger slices.\r\n4. I like a tad more spice than was in this recipe so added a small pinch of dried Thai red chili pepper with the black pepper - perfect!\r\n\r\nThis sauce is so delicious that I will be using it in other dishes. For instance, it makes a fantastic pasta sauce - you can use chicken thighs in this for a fabulously flavorful pasta dish!"
