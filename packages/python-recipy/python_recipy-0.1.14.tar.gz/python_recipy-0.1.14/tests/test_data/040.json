    "description": "In this recipe, shishito peppers are sliced, lightly sautéed, then tossed with raw summer corn and a cumin-lime vinaigrette for a summer salad that’s crunchy, smoky and a little spicy. Traditionally used in Japanese and Korean cooking, shishitos are small, thin-skinned green peppers that have become increasingly popular in the United States. They are typically mild in flavor, but the occasional pepper packs a spicy punch. If you can’t find them, use diced green bell peppers in their place. Finally, cilantro-averse cooks can substitute fresh mint.",

I prepped in the morning then assembled about an hour before dinner so could serve the dish at room temperature. I opted to use feta and cilantro. I doubled the shishito’s and made a bit extra dressing since I used 6 ears of corn which appeared to be way more than three cups. No matter how much corn I use next time, I’ll keep the extra shishito’s...so delicious!",

The husband has a dislike of spicy, so I added 1 smallish heirloom tomato to balance it. Perfect. I'm making it again for the Labor Day cookout this weekend!",

Having fresh corn from our local farmers market made a difference too - corn has been very sweet this season.I did 3 tbl lime juice, 1 tbl oil - 2 tbl oil would have been way too much.\nAs a bonus, I used the cobs to make corn stock, just deciding exactly what soup I want to make with it.",

We’ve made it twice and neither time succeeded in stopping ourselves (two people) from consuming THE ENTIRE huge bowl’s worth.  Other commenters are right; 5-6 cobs is definitely more corn than 3 cups, but 5 cobs is just right for me.  And yeah, the commenter who said the dinner guests freaked out over how good it was?  I’d lose my mind if someone served this to me, too.  Delish.  Make it tonight.",

Shucking and stripping the corn takes almost that long unless you don't care about removing all the silk. That aside, this is really good. Followed the recipe as shown, using Feta. Did let the shishito peppers cool to room temp before mixing everything together. Definitely will fix this again. I do find it very aggravating when recipe times are so very far off and it's not just this one. Be realistic!",
