    "description": "Adapted from Ready for Dessert\r\n\r\nThese super chocolate cookies are packed with flavor. The trick is to bake them just enough so they're almost cooked through, but not quite. \r\n\r\nFor those who are gluten-free, you can substitute 6 tablespoons (52g) of teff flour for the regular flour. The cookies may spread a bit more if using something other than wheat flour. If you try another flour, I might go with the full 1/2 cup (70g) of something like buckwheat or gluten-free oat flour. If you try them with something else, feel free to let us know in the comments how they work out.",
