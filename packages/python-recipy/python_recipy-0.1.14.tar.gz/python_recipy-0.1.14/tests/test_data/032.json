Anyway, it’s the marinade that makes the dish; it’s absolutely delicious even if the meat is cooked in a cast iron grill on the stovetop. Please try this marinade on your skirt steak—regardless of how you cook it—it’s fantastic."

When I am ready to use the meat I let it defrost in the bag. Grill it on a wood fire and Oh Boy. I have never served this to my guests and not had rave reviews. I \"try\" to keep the recipe a secret ; I also have used this for portobello mushrooms letting it sit in the marinade for an hour or two and it makes them taste out of this world as well.

I like it a little heavier on the garlic and pepper flakes so I add more but you can omit this completely if you want, you will find that anything goes.  I use  this recipe to marinade other cuts too such as tri tip and it works awesome. I also like to marinade for longer then the recipe states but be careful about going too long because the citrus will cook the meat but overnight works good.  I also sometimes freeze the skirt steak in the marinade and then I can just defrost and cook.  I don't go as far as cooking directly on the hard wood charcoal or the hair dryer and I use regular Kingsford charcoal but grill as close to the heat as I can get (about an inch or less and get killer results. It is very important to let the meat rest befoe slicing against the grain and as thin as you can,"

We have a gas grill and I did leave a bit of the marinade on the meat when I grilled it, left all burners on highest setting, and cooked about 2 minutes on each side... simply fabulous.  I also left the meat sitting in the marinade for way more than hour - closer to 3-4 actually, and it was as tender as butter.  Will probably use this or some variation of this marinade in future, as flap steak is becoming easier to find and is an economical alternative to the more expensive cuts."

Marinated it for about 2 hours, then wiped the marinade off and put olive oil on it before cooking so it wouldn't stick to the grill.  next time I think I'll use pineapple juice instead of lime juice, and maybe add a bit more brown sugar, as I like a little sweetness to my marinade.  The marinade made the steak as tender as a rib-eye, which is my favorite cut.  Served it with vegetables cooked on the grill, and roasted fingerling potatoes.  Watermelon and cantelope for dessert.  I'll definitely use this marinade again."

Most everyone agrees that the marinade is great but the cooking method is HORRIBLE! Try eating steak that is covered in crunchy bits of charcoal. Yuck! We had to throw it out. I really respect Alton Brown but this recipe was a huge disappointment."

I was so surprised how well this worked, when I did this my friends looked at me like I was nuts. Didn't have hair dryer so I used a piece of cardboard and just fanned it really hard. I don't think you can use reg charcoal, not one drop of ash was on my steaks what so ever. I did use my own marinade though, bourbon brown sugar soy and garlic. Amazing way to cook a steak, from here on out I will start cooking all of my steaks using this method"

I am a big fan of skirt steaks and marinating is clearly the way to go but I don't think I will bother with this one again without significant changes.  My thoughts are it was low in the spices considering it had over 1 cup of liquid (oil, lime juice, soy sauce and only 1/2 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp pepper flakes.  I will probably halve the oil, soy, lime and increase the cumin by double.     Perhaps replace the pepper flakes with a single chipotle en adobo to bump up the flavor while keeping the heat about the same."

I did not have time to fire up the grill so I used a cast iron griddle using the grill side.

Any caveman that didn't think this recipe was an upgrade to his usual style of cooking the bronto wasn't on the evolving branch of our family tree.

My wife and I did not. Great marinade; lousy everything else."
