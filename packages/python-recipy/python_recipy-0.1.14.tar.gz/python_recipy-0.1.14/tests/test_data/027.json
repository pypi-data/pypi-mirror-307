Honestly it could be used as just a snack food, which I plan to do in the future.\r\n\r\nThe meal itself was wonderful and loved by the whole family.  I did make a substitution based on the comments since I don't like parmesan cheese.  Someone mentioned they used sour cream, so I substituted that instead and the flavor was spectacular.    Overall I bookmarked this recipe and will make it again.    Thank you!!",
