He abandoned his life as a software engineer and went into the fire (literally) when he manned the woodfired oven at the famed Brooklyn pizza joint Roberta’s. Justin approaches trashy food like a master sommelier approaches wine, nailing down the ultimate corn chip or chicken strip. Most nights in New York, you can find Justin performing improv or comedy and eating dollar pizza off an oily plate.</p>",
