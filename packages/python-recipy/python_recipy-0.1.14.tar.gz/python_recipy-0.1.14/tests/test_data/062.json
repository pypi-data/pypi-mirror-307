I've been obsessed with pesto, and that has extended to grilled cheese all summer but this tomatoes sauce concoction: next level! Such a delicious sweetness to the cooked tomatoes. This sandwich has the honor of being the last meal we make in our apartment before moving into our first house. Can't wait to make your recipes in my new kitchen!"
