I made it as written except that I used white rice instead of brown because it is what I had on hand. I cut the recipe in half because I was making it just for myself and I didn't want to eat leftovers for a week. The taste is really good! I ate 2 of these as wraps as suggested, then I ate the 1 serving as beef and rice bowl without the lettuce, and the final serving was in a bowl minus the rice and lettuce. I enjoyed it all three ways, and will make it again. Lynne German, Volunteer Field Editor",
