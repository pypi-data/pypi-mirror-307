I would take a look in your produce section near the bagged salad, it's a great alternative! "

Due to the fact that broccoli and tomatoes are not in season together, I used sun dried tomatoes instead, awesome addition.  I also increased the amount of lemon juice.  This would be amazing on a antipasta buffet!  I'm glad to have found this recipe, I'm always looking for new ideas for raw broccoli rather than the standard broccoli, raisin, bacon salad.

I also used candied pecans because its what I had on hand.  This dish is excellent and I will definitely make it again and again. "

Raw broccoli is just not that great by itself, but this healthy and simple dressing is just what broccoli needed!  Will definitely make this again."
