Whitfield’s original Kitty Highball recipe—equal parts red wine and ginger ale over ice—was printed alongside the beefier, Brit-leaning Bull Dog Highball, consisting of orange juice, dry gin, and ginger ale. Much to the delight of cat people, the Kitty was the easier source for Fresh Kills Bar to riff on when they were looking for low-ABV inspiration. This contemporary adaptation deconstructs the ginger ale into separate syrup and soda elements.",
