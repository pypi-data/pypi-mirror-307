There was no need to add any extra seasonings.I also substituted the beef consomme for extra beef broth, since I couldn't find the consomme at my grocery store.My veggies were tender after 30 minutes.  I will enjoy eating the leftovers.",

I always add more beef broth, more wine, and onions, potatoes, carrots and one stalk of celery. I use rosemary, oregano and basil for seasoning with salt and pepper (all to taste.) This recipe is amazing and a great guideline because as a cook you should always take the liberty to make it your own. I just sniff ingredients and add them as my heart wants them. Definitely worth the 5 stars.Enjoy!",
