        "description": "Diners—and the chefs who feed them—are embracing retro dishes. At New York City's The Darby, Alexandra Guarnaschelli perused old supper-club menus for inspiration and came away with ideas for dishes like this cheese soufflé and a chilled tomato soup that are classics that never go out of style. The light and airy soufflé in this video boasts both Parmigiano-Reggiano and Gruyère cheeses, and gets a little sharp complexity from Dijon mustard and dry mustard. Pair it with a vinaigrette-dressed salad and a baguette for an elegant lunch.",

I used the correct cooking vessel size and measured the ingredients perfectly. After 35 minutes of cooking it was not cooked all the way through. I did give it a shake and it appeared cooked. However, when I went to serve, it was still raw in the middle! Yikes, back in the oven which didn’t ruin it. I am a classically French trained cook so this wasn’t my first attempt at a soufflé. I will have to tweak this recipe a bit in order for it to come out correctly.",

            "reviewBody": "It seems as though many people are beginner cooks so here are the problems: The recipe is confusing for some people since it uses American volume measurements then says 6 ounces of cheese. That is 6 ounces in weight, not volume. The two cups by volume is correct and the soufflé shouldn’t be “oily” if the recipe is made correctly. A better recipe might say 2 cups of cheese, keeping the measurements consistent then adding a volume weight after it, for those who want precision. Perhaps some people are using table salt or making errors in measurement. This recipe has approximately 300 grams of sodium using averages for the cheeses and Kosher salt. This is as “salty” as a plain, unseasoned bagel. I doubt the commenters who found this too salty also think a plain bagel is too salty to be edible, considering millions are sold in America and are even eaten with saltier food (like lox!). So the error is in the cook, not a few people who have hypersensitivity to salt. Lastly, sherry doesn’t have any sodium. Some cheap cooking wines do, since salt is used as a preservative. Solution: don’t buy wine with added salt. So the problems seem to be people who confuse weight for volume, table salt for Kosher salt, and salted cooking wine for sherry; or are just experienced and not following directions accurately. These seem to be a minority of F&amp;W readers since the recipe still has thousands of 5 star ratings.",
