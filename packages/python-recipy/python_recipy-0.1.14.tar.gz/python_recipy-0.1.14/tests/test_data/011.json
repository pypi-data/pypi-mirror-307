Vigorously shake the strainer to expel excess moisture then dump the beans into a small bowl. Let sit for a few minutes to partially hydrate and soften. Use a fork to mash the beans to a coarse texture (you shouldn’t see many whole beans). Mix in the garlic, chile, sugar, soy sauce, rice wine, and oil. Stir well then transfer to a jar. Refrigerate to keep for weeks. This makes about 1/2 cup.",
