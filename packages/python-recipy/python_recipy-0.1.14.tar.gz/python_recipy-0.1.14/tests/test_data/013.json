    "description": "If eggs are okay with your diet, serve the rice in individual bowls, each topped with a fried egg. You can keep or omit the tofu. If you’re fine with meat, substitute some chicken, beef or pork. It can be cooked or raw, so long as you cut it into small pieces that distribute well throughout the rice. Offer soy sauce on the side, if you like.",
