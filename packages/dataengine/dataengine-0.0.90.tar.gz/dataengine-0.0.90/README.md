## Development

### Setting up a python virtual environment

1. Create the virtual environment with any name you'd like (in this example we'll use "myenv"

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

2. Activate the environemt

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the package requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When you're done using the environment you can deactivate it with the following command:

```bash
deactivate
```
