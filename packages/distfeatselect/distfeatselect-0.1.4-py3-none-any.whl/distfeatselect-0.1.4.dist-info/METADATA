## Overview
distfeatselect is a Python package implementing an innovative Distributed Feature Selection algorithm based on vertical data partitioning and distributed searching. By dividing features into subsets and assigning dedicated processors for local searches, the algorithm achieves parallelism and scalability, making it suitable for large-scale datasets. The distributed architecture enhances efficiency by operating on smaller search spaces, reducing computational time. Moreover, algorithm's tendency to produce simple model structures enhances interpretability and robustness. 

The DFS (Distributed Feature Selection) algorithm is implemented as a scikit-learn-compatible transformer, adhering to the scikit-learn API standards. This enables seamless integration into scikit-learn workflows, empowering users to incorporate distributed feature selection into their machine learning pipelines.
