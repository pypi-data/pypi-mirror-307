# Pywatch Tracker 
This Python Package is for making coincidence measurements 
with the 
<a href="http://www.cosmicwatch.lns.mit.edu/">CosmicWatch</a> 
Detectors. The measurements can be done with as many detectors as can 
be connected to the computer. 
The measurement can also be displayed live in a three-dimensional visualisation 
in the browser with any possible detector geometry.

## Installation 
Open the terminal and run the following command:
```commandline
pip install pywatch-tracker
```
which installs the `pywatch` package.
