pypostfix is a Python library designed for manipulating expressions in both infix and postfix notation (Reverse Polish Notation, or RPN).

This library provides tools to seamlessly convert between these notations, evaluate expressions, and utilize stack-based operations.

With pypostfix, users can easily parse and compute expressions, making it ideal for applications involving mathematical computations and algorithms that rely on stack structures.
