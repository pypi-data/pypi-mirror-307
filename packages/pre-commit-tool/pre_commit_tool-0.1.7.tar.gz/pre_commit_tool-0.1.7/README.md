## Commands

- **help** - Print help
- **install** - Install pre-commit hooks using `pre-commit install-hooks ...`
- **run** - Run pre-commit hooks using `pre-commit run-hooks ...`
- **sync** - Sync and garbage-collect pre-commit hooks
- **update** - Update pre-commit hooks using `pre-commit autoupdate ...`
- **upgrade** - Alias for `update`
- **use** - "Use" (install) the pre-commit tool with `uv tool install ...`
- **validate** - Validate the pre-commit config file

Any command can be given with or without a leading `--` (that is, `--help` is the same as `help`).

Most commands take additional arguments that get passed on to `pre-commit`.

Most commands require a '.pre-commit-config.yaml' to be present.


## Installation

Use your favorite way of installing Python packages. It's really easy with [uv][uv-install]):

    uv tool install pre-commit-tool
    uvx pre-commit-tool help

You can also add this package as a development dependency to a `uv`-managed project:

    uv add --dev pre-commit-tool
    uv run pre-commit-tool help
