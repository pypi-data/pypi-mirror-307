<p>scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. See the About us page for a list of core contributors.

It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers.

Scikit-learn 0.20 was the last version to support Python 2.7 and Python 3.4. scikit-learn 1.0 and later require Python 3.7 or newer. scikit-learn 1.1 and later require Python 3.8 or newer.

Scikit-learn plotting capabilities (i.e., functions start with plot_ and classes end with Display) require Matplotlib (>= 3.3.4). For running the examples Matplotlib >= 3.3.4 is required. A few examples require scikit-image >= 0.17.2, a few examples require pandas >= 1.1.5, some examples require seaborn >= 0.9.0 and plotly >= 5.14.0.</p>
