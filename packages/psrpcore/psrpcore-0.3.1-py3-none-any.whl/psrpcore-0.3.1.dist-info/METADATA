Core library for PowerShell Remoting Protocol (PSRP) in Python.
This library enables you to write either client or a server side implementation for PSRP.
It does not provide any IO or concurrency logic as it's designed to be a pure Python implementation that is then used by other library.
This follows the [sans-IO](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/) paradigm to promote re-usability and have it focus purely on the protocol logic.
