## 📦 Implemented Modules

### 1. `io.py` - Audio I/O Operations

Handles loading and saving audio files with support for various file formats. Resamples audio to the specified sample rate and converts it to mono if required.

#### Functions

- **`load_audio(file_path, sample_rate=16000, mono=True)`**: Loads audio, resamples to the target rate, and optionally converts to mono.
- **`save_audio(file_path, audio, sample_rate=16000)`**: Saves audio data to a specified path and supports `.wav`, `.flac`, `.mp3`, and `.ogg` formats.

#### Example

```python
from sappl.io import load_audio, save_audio

audio_data = load_audio("path/to/file.wav", sample_rate=16000, mono=True)
print("Audio loaded:", audio_data.shape)

save_audio("path/to/save_file.wav", audio_data, sample_rate=16000)
print("Audio saved successfully.")
```

---

### 2. `transform.py` - Time-Frequency Transformations

Performs transformations like Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and inverse STFT, as well as conversions between magnitude and phase. All outputs follow the `(T, F)` format, where `T` is time and `F` is frequency, making it ideal for deep learning.

#### Functions

- **`stft(audio, n_fft=2048, hop_length=512, win_length=None, center=False, pad_mode='reflect')`**: 
   Computes the STFT of an audio signal and returns a `(T, F)` matrix. If `center=True`, pads the signal so each frame is centered around its FFT window. The `pad_mode` parameter defines the padding mode when `center=True`.

- **`istft(stft_matrix, hop_length=512, win_length=None, center=False)`**: 
   Reconstructs audio from an STFT matrix, with the option to trim padding if `center=True`.

- **`magphase(stft_matrix)`**: 
   Separates the magnitude and phase components of the STFT matrix, returning both in `(T, F)` format.

- **`compute_mel_spectrogram(audio, sample_rate=16000, n_fft=2048, hop_length=512, n_mels=128, f_min=0.0, f_max=None, center=False, pad_mode='reflect')`**: 
   Computes the Mel spectrogram of the audio signal in dB scale. If `center=True`, pads the signal so each frame is centered around its FFT window, with `pad_mode` controlling the padding style.

- **`reconstruct_waveform(magnitude, phase, hop_length=512, win_length=None, center=False)`**: 
   Reconstructs the waveform from magnitude and phase spectrograms, with the option to trim padding when `center=True`.


#### Example

```python
from sappl.transform import stft, istft, magphase, compute_mel_spectrogram

# Compute STFT
from sappl.transform import stft, istft, magphase, compute_mel_spectrogram, reconstruct_waveform
from sappl.io import load_audio

# Load audio data
audio_data = load_audio("path/to/audio_file.wav", sample_rate=16000, mono=True)

# Compute STFT with center=False (no padding) and default hop length and FFT size
stft_matrix = stft(audio_data, center=False)
print("STFT shape:", stft_matrix.shape)

# Separate magnitude and phase
magnitude, phase = magphase(stft_matrix)
print("Magnitude shape:", magnitude.shape)
print("Phase shape:", phase.shape)

# Compute Mel spectrogram with center=False to avoid padding
mel_spec = compute_mel_spectrogram(audio_data, sample_rate=16000, center=False)
print("Mel spectrogram shape:", mel_spec.shape)

# Reconstruct waveform from magnitude and phase with center=False
reconstructed_audio = reconstruct_waveform(magnitude, phase, hop_length=512, center=False)
print("Reconstructed audio shape:", reconstructed_audio.shape)

```

### 3. `utils.py` - Utility Functions

Provides utilities for handling audio data, such as padding, truncation, mono conversion, and normalization methods.

#### Functions

- **`convert_to_mono(audio)`**: Converts stereo audio to mono by averaging channels.
- **`pad_audio(audio, max_length, sample_rate, padding_value=0.0)`**: Pads audio to a specified duration.
- **`truncate_audio(audio, max_length, sample_rate)`**: Truncates audio to a specified duration.
- **`normalize(audio, method="min_max")`**: Normalizes audio using `min_max`, `standard`, `peak`, or `rms` methods.
- **`rms_normalize(audio, target_db=-20.0)`**: Normalizes audio to a target RMS level in dB.

#### Example

```python
from sappl.utils import convert_to_mono, pad_audio, truncate_audio, normalize, rms_normalize

# Convert to mono
mono_audio = convert_to_mono(audio_data)
print("Mono audio shape:", mono_audio.shape)

# Pad to 5 seconds
padded_audio = pad_audio(mono_audio, max_length=5.0, sample_rate=16000)
print("Padded audio shape:", padded_audio.shape)

# Normalize using peak normalization
peak_normalized = normalize(mono_audio, method="peak")
print("Peak-normalized min/max:", peak_normalized.min(), peak_normalized.max())

# RMS normalize to -20 dB
rms_normalized = rms_normalize(mono_audio, target_db=-20.0)
print("RMS-normalized min/max:", rms_normalized.min(), rms_normalized.max())
```

### 4. `feature_extraction.py` - Feature Extraction

Extracts key audio features useful for machine learning tasks, such as MFCC, Chroma, Tonnetz, Zero-Crossing Rate, and Spectral Contrast.

#### Functions

- **`extract_mfcc`**: Computes Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).
- **`extract_chroma`**: Extracts chroma features.
- **`extract_tonnetz`**: Extracts tonal centroid features.
- **`extract_zero_crossing_rate`**: Computes the zero-crossing rate.
- **`extract_spectral_contrast`**: Computes spectral contrast, capturing peak-valley differences in energy across frequency bands.

#### Example

```python
from sappl.feature_extraction import extract_mfcc, extract_chroma, extract_tonnetz, extract_zero_crossing_rate, extract_spectral_contrast

# Extract MFCCs
mfcc = extract_mfcc(audio_data, sample_rate=16000)
print("MFCC shape:", mfcc.shape)

# Extract Chroma features
chroma = extract_chroma(audio_data, sample_rate=16000)
print("Chroma shape:", chroma.shape)

# Extract Tonnetz features
tonnetz = extract_tonnetz(audio_data, sample_rate=16000)
print("Tonnetz shape:", tonnetz.shape)
```

### 5. `processor.py` - Audio Processor Class

The `AudioProcessor` class provides centralized access to all core functions in SAPPL, acting as an adaptable interface for loading, saving, transforming, and extracting features from audio files. It simplifies audio processing by allowing users to set processing parameters once at initialization (e.g., `n_fft`, `hop_length`, `n_mels`), reducing the need to pass them repeatedly for each function call.

#### Example

```python
from sappl.processor import AudioProcessor

# Initialize AudioProcessor with default parameters, setting them once
processor = AudioProcessor(sample_rate=16000, max_length=5.0, n_fft=1024, hop_length=256, n_mels=40)

# Load and preprocess audio
audio = processor.load_audio("path/to/file.wav")
audio_mono = processor.convert_to_mono(audio)
normalized_audio = processor.normalize(audio_mono, method="peak")

# Extract MFCC features
mfcc_features = processor.extract_mfcc(normalized_audio)
print("MFCC features shape:", mfcc_features.shape)

# Compute STFT and Mel Spectrogram
stft_matrix = processor.stft(normalized_audio)
mel_spectrogram = processor.compute_mel_spectrogram(normalized_audio)
print("Mel Spectrogram shape:", mel_spectrogram.shape)

# Reconstruct waveform from magnitude and phase
magnitude, phase = processor.magphase(stft_matrix)
reconstructed_audio = processor.reconstruct_waveform(magnitude, phase)
print("Reconstructed audio shape:", reconstructed_audio.shape)
```
