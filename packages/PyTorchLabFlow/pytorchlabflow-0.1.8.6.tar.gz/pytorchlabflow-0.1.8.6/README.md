**PyTorchLabFlow** is your go-to offline solution for managing PyTorch experiments with ease. Run experiments securely on your local machine, no data sharing with third parties. Need more power? Seamlessly trasfer your setup to a high-end system without any reconfiguration. Wheather you are on a laptop or a workstation, PyTorchLabFlow ensures flexibility and privacy, allowing you to experiment anywhere, anytime, without internet dependency.

## Features
These are not all features that **PyTorchLabFlow** provides, here are ony few. Read more features with more detailing at[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=GitHub&color=black&logo=github&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/BBEK-Anand/PyTorchLabFlow)

### Setting up project
    - use `setup_project` for initiate a project.

### Training multiple experiments sequentialy
    - use `multi_train` to train multiple experiments to a specified epoch (`last_epoch`).

### Test model dataset compactibility at the time of model designing
    - use `test_mods` to check model's compactibility to dataset.

### Transfer experiment to a high-end system
    - use `transfer` to make all nessessary files of experiments to `internal/Transfer` folder, and then copy the folder to other system.

### Use previous experiment configurations
    - use `use_ppl` to initiate a new experiment with some modified configurations generaly for hyperparameter tuning.

### Plot performance of multiple experiments at a time
    - use `performance_plot` to plot experiments' performance over epochs individualy but at a time.
