# Indomee

**Indomee** is a Python package designed to simplify the evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models and other retrieval-based systems. With `indomee`, you can compute common evaluation metrics like **recall** and **mean reciprocal rank (MRR)** at various levels of _k_, all through a straightforward API. Additionally, `indomee` provides tools for **statistical analysis**, including **t-testing**, **bootstrapping**, and **confidence interval (CI) calculations**.
