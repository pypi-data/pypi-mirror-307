# carrot-transform

TODO: 
* Document carrot-transform 
* Add more comments in-code
* Handle capture of ddl and json config via the command-line as optional args

Reduction in complexity over the original CaRROT-CDM version for the Transform part of *ETL* - In practice *Extract* is always 
performed by Data Partners, *Load* by database bulk-load software.
