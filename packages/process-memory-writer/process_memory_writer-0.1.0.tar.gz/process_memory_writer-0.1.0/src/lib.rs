/*!
 * process_memory_writer.rs
 *
 * This module provides the `MemoryWriter` class, which allows reading and writing memory
 * of another process on Windows systems via a Python extension using PyO3 and Rust.
 *
 * # Overview
 *
 * The `MemoryWriter` class enables users to:
 *
 * - **Open a process** by its executable name.
 * - **Read memory** from the target process.
 * - **Write memory** to the target process.
 * - **Continuously write data** to a specific memory address in the process.
 *
 * # Safety and Security Considerations
 *
 * - Modifying another process's memory can be dangerous and may cause system instability.
 * - Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to manipulate the target process.
 * - Be aware of legal implications and software licenses when using this functionality.
