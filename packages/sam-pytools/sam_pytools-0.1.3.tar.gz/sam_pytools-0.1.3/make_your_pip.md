**Make PIP your self**

1. `git clone https://github.com/humblesami/pytils.git`
2. `cd pytils`
3. Find and replace `sam_pytools` with your own `your_module_name`
4. Put the code of app in folder root/your_module_name

**Build and test using sample_usage locally**

rm -r dist/*

rm -r build/*

install python

create your virtual environment

activate the virtual environment

`pip install --use-pep517 -r requirements.txt`

`python -m build`

**Test your just built package before upload**

`pip uninstall -y your_module_name`

`pip install dist/your_module_name-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`

**Upload your pip**

Install twine

`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get install twine`

https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

`pip install twine`

`twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*`

`twine upload dist/*`

**Final Step, Upload to Production**

`twine upload dist/* --config-file .pypirc_prod`

*After upload Install the uploaded package*

pip install your_module_name
