## Introduction

Picomet allows you to build Single Page Applications (SPAs) with Server-Side Rendering (SSR) capabilities, seamlessly integrated with Django. What sets this framework apart is its ability to update any specific part of a page by partially rending it on the server and to render Alpinejs syntax on the server.

## Features

-   🏚️ Single page app
-   🔎 Partial rendering
-   🏯 Nested layout
-   ☎️ Server action
-   ⚡ Hot module reload
-   🌲 Alpinejs support
-   🖌️ Tailwind support
