# SpacePy

SpacePy is a package for Python, targeted at the space sciences, that aims to make basic data analysis, modeling and visualization easier. It builds on the capabilities of the well-known NumPy and MatPlotLib packages. Publication quality output direct from analyses is emphasized among other goals:

 - Quickly obtain data
 - Read (and write) data from (and to) data formats like NASA CDF and HDF5
 - Create publications quality plots
 - Perform complicated analysis easily
 - Run common empirical models
 - Change coordinates and time systems effortlessly
 - Harness the power of Python

The SpacePy project seeks to promote accurate and open research standards by providing an open environment for code development. In the space physics community there has long been a significant reliance on proprietary languages that restrict free transfer of data and reproducibility of results. By providing a comprehensive, open-source library of widely-used analysis and visualization tools in a free, modern and intuitive language, we hope that this reliance will be diminished.

To help foster an open and welcoming environment, we have adopted a [code of conduct](https://github.com/spacepy/spacepy/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) that we encourage members of the SpacePy community to read and follow.

## Getting SpacePy

Our latest release version is available through PyPI and can be installed using

```
pip install spacepy --user
```

This will also automatically install most dependencies.

The latest "bleeding-edge" source code is available from our github repository at [https://github.com/spacepy/spacepy](https://github.com/spacepy/spacepy).

Further installation documentation, including building from source and OS-specific information, can be found [here](https://spacepy.github.io/install.html). Full documentation is at [https://spacepy.github.io](https://spacepy.github.io).

SpacePy supports Python 3.7 and later.

### Dependencies

SpacePy has a number of well-maintained dependencies which are automatically installed by ```pip```. These include:

 - numpy (>=1.15.1)
 - dateutil (>=2.5)
 - scipy (>=1.0)
 - matplotlib (>=3.1)
 - h5py (>=2.10)
