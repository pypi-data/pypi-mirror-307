# jenc-py

  * Working - jenc/Markor decrypt tool
  * Not yet working - jenc/Markor encrypt tool

The aim is to have a pure python (with crypto dependencies) [jenc](https://github.com/opensource21/jpencconverter) (as used by [Markor](https://github.com/gsantner/markor)) decrypt/encrypt library.


Test jenc file https://github.com/opensource21/jpencconverter/blob/master/src/test/encrypted/Test3.md.jenc
Test password `geheim` from https://github.com/opensource21/jpencconverter/blob/master/src/test/resources/application.properties

## jenc file format

There are multiple versions V001 (and the old U001).

File format:

  * 4 bytes - define the version.
  * nonce bytes - bytes as nonce for cipher depends. The length depends on the version.
  * salt bytes - bytes to salt the password. The length depends on the version.
  * content bytes - the encrypted content-bytes.

From the original Java code for jpencconverter it appears that strings are converted to/from UTF-8 (i.e. passwords and plaintext).

### jenc file format - V001
