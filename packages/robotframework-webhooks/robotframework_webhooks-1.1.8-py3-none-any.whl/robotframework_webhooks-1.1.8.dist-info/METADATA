# robotframework-webhooks

This repository contains a custom listener designed for the Robot Framework to enhance test management and immediacy in response. When a test case fails, the listener triggers an automatic notification to a specified *Microsoft Teams* channel using Webhooks. This ensures that the team is instantly alerted, enabling prompt investigation and action. like this
