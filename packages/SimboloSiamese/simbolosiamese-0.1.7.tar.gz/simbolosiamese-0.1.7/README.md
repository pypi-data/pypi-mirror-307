### Here's an extended version of your text with additional information about Burmese-to-Romanization:

Provides a tool for syllable-based tokenization of Burmese text. It breaks down Burmese text into individual syllables, facilitating language processing tasks such as text analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP) for Burmese.

### Features

Syllable Tokenization: Tokenizes Burmese text into syllables based on Unicode rules. It helps in language segmentation and provides a clear framework for analyzing Burmese sentences in a structured manner.

Efficient Processing: Designed to handle large text efficiently with minimal memory overhead, making it scalable for tasks involving big data or large-scale text analysis.

Burmese Unicode Support: Fully supports Burmese script and syllable rules as defined by the Burmese Unicode standard, ensuring that the tokenization aligns with native Burmese text structure.

Burmese-to-Romanization: Converts Burmese script into its Romanized equivalent, facilitating pronunciation guidance and helping non-native speakers understand Burmese text. The Romanization process follows the standard linguistic rules for Burmese phonetic transcription, offering a bridge for users unfamiliar with the Burmese script to read, pronounce, and comprehend the language. This feature can be particularly useful for language learners, cross-lingual applications, and linguistic studies that require Romanized Burmese text.

### How to use (Getting Started)

```
# Install the SimboloSiamese package using pip
# pip install SimboloSiamese

# Import the BurmeseConverter from the Siamese module
from Siamese import BurmeseConverter

converter = BurmeseConverter()

# Example: Zawgyi to Unicode
zawgyi_text = "ဖြွှော်"
try:
    # Convert Zawgyi text to Unicode
    unicode_output = converter.zawgyi_to_unicode(zawgyi_text)
    # Print the Unicode output
    print("Unicode Output:", unicode_output)
except Exception as e:
    # Handle any errors that occur during conversion
    print(f"Error in Zawgyi to Unicode conversion: {e}")

# Example: Tokenization of a Burmese word
tokenization_text = "တက္ကသိုလ်"
try:
    # Tokenize the Burmese word. 1 means With the virama mark. If you dont want to tokenize the virama mark, you can type any numbers except 1
    tokenized_output = converter.syllable_tokenization(1, tokenization_text) # try with process_text in case it cannot work with syllable_tokenization
    print("Tokenized Output:", tokenized_output)
except Exception as e:
    # Handle any errors that occur during tokenization
    print(f"Cannot Tokenize the word: {e}")

# Example: Convert Burmese text to Romanized script
burmese_text = "ကော်"
try:
    # Convert Burmese text to Romanized script
    romanized_output = converter.burmese_to_romanization(burmese_text)
    # Print the Romanized output
    print("Romanized Output:", romanized_output)
except Exception as e:
    # Handle any errors that occur during Romanization
    print(f"Error in Burmese Romanization: {e}")

# Example: Romanization Burmese
burmese_text = "le kReAc: liuc:, K rI: sq a mHt, ၂ ၂ ၈ ၃, jQ, SeAF piu liu mRiu., lU ne rp kWk peAF jiu., pYk kY KL. pRI:, liuk pA lA jU, ၆ ၂, OO: s luN:, je SuN: KL. jQ // "
try:
    burmese_output = converter.romanization_to_burmese(burmese_text)
    print("Burmese Output:", burmese_output)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error in Romanization Burmese: {e}")
