\subsection{Biol. Demo Protocol}\label{sec:biol_}
\timeblockstart
\timeblocktotal{3.6}
Here, I am demonstrating biological samples at 10\uM.

\subsubsection{initial setup}\maxminutes{57}
\paragraph{first time}
Be sure to carry over:
\begin{itemize}
    \item microcentrifuge tubes
    \item toolbox 
    \item multimeter 
    \item samples (leave in my box in CNSI fridge)
    \item magnifying glasses
\end{itemize}

$B_0$ field off, air off, everything else on, and swap the dewar for the quartz tube.

Attach air tube to temperature control, insert, turn on temp control.

\paragraph{always}
Be sure to change section title and label!!!

Copy section label to list for the day.

$B_0$ field off, air off.

\paragraph{capillary prep}
\subparagraph{using the sealed tubes}

Cut a decent length of tube.

Put capillary on GELoader tip, and turn pipette upside down.

Centrifuge sample down at 1000 rpm.

Cut again, then add critoseal and withdraw air with pipette

Put stuff back in fridge!

Measure sample.

Insert in probe.

\subsubsection{Quick ESR in probe}\maxminutes{11}
Put into tune mode, $40\;dB$ first.

Insert probe, and turn up air to 12~SCFH (since a new sample, just use a higher flow rate).

Move to near 9.77 and autotune.

\paragraph{test for signal}
try same parameters as her.

try to increase the modulation amplitude, just to see signal.

zoom in and repeat.

check for saturation 15, down by 3~dB.

save saturated scan.
\fn{dna_cs14_overmod_sat_120314}

use a power slightly before saturation.

Make an experiment with this power, but turn down the modulation amplitude and change the receiver window and the resolution and number of scans.

Increase the modulation amplitude to 2~G.

\paragraph{actual ESR}
Turn on field.

Copy experiment.
\fn{dna_cs14_overmod_120314}

\paragraph{always}
Run actual scan.

Save ESR.
\fn{dna_cs14_bound_overmod_120314}

Cntrl-S after scan is finished.

Hit Cntrl-A for ssh transfer and process.

\begin{tiny}
\begin{lstlisting}
fl = figlistl()
standard_epr(dir = DATADIR+'cnsi_data',
    files = ['dna_cs14_overmod_120314',
        'dna_cs14_bound_overmod_120314',
        'dna_cs14_nl_bound_overmod_120314',
        'dna_cs14_unbound_overmod_120315'],
    figure_list = fl)
fl.show(thisjobname()+'.pdf')
\end{lstlisting}
\end{tiny}

\paragraph{determine ratio}
\ntd{I don't have git set up right here, but later, I should paste the ratio procedure here}
\subsubsection{DNP Experimental Setup}

\paragraph{tune NMR, when I'm not using microwave power}
Set switch to DNP amp, set bridge to standby.

Attach probe w/ coil perpendicular to $B_0$ + at correct height, then turn on air (14~SCFM).

Turn on $B_0$ field.

Make a new NMR experiment based on template, and change into that experiment.

(leaving sfo1 at the value you used for DNP) \texttt{wobb}. \adlin{back moves lf/right front moves down/up}

\texttt{p1 1u}, then use \texttt{jf\_setmw} to center resonance in \texttt{gs}.

\paragraph{tune and set resonant field}
Attach probe w/ coil perpendicular to $B_0$ + at correct height, then turn on air (20~SCFM).

Put into tune mode before inserting sample, and turn down power.

Move to near 9.77 and autotune + turn on $B_0$ field.

Make a new NMR experiment based on template, and change into that experiment.

\fn{dopc_984mM_120503}

Set sfo1 to (ppt value)*(YIG frequency), then \texttt{wobb}. \adlin{back moves lf/right front moves down/up}

Check the ESR tune by hand up to 0~dB and record microwave frequency.
\begin{python}[off]
calcfielddata(9.790094,'mtsl','cnsi')
\end{python}
Put ESR bridge in standby mode and disconnect the mod coil.

Set the field to a reasonable value (last value usually fine, if not use the value from the ratio).

Use \texttt{jf\_setmw} to set frequency ratio and YIG frequency.
Check that the YIG's DC power supply reads 0.26-0.27~A with first light on and other lights green.

\texttt{jf\_zg} for signal about 15 high, then set it on resonance (lightning bolt o1).

Use \texttt{jf\_setmw} to center resonance in \texttt{gs}.

\paragraph{calibrate 90 time and $T_1$}

Run \texttt{jf_zg}; zoom in; \texttt{dpl1}; then \texttt{paropt} with \texttt{p1},8,1,3 which gives signal at 8\us, 9\us, and 10\us pulse length, which should be $\approx 360^o$.

Flip the waveguide switch so the amp is connected (not the bridge).

If needed, run a rough experiment to determine the $T_1$ time, and put it in experiment 101.

        r' $s$ with heating')
\end{python}
\end{scriptsize}
\paragraph{determine $T_1(t)$}
Use jf\_dnp to determine number of points for a scan 17~min long:
DOPC 32\mM $\Rightarrow$ min 3.4 of max of 3.6

Run jf\_t10s:
Set 15 experiments at 17~min for 2h50m, exp 4$\Rightarrow$ 501.

Come back after it ran.

\paragraph{run DNP}
Start jf\_dnp, and write down $T_1$ times entered.
bound CS19 $\Rightarrow$ 1.5 to 2.1 to be safe
DOPC high concentration $\Rightarrow$ 0.67 to 0.8 to be safe

\subsubsection{ESR}\maxminutes{11}

(Here, I run ESR after the DNP, so I don't have to worry about timing, but still get the double integral)
Put into tune mode, $40\;dB$ first.

Load sample in the teflon sample holder (I want ~77 $mm$ from collet to bottom of sample, need to remeasure) -- weight the top with the collet holder.

Move to near 9.77 and autotune.

Open ESR parameter set similar to this one.
\fn{grocomplex_120202.par}

Turn on field.

Copy experiment.

If not exactly the same type of sample, test run to check some stuff.

\precaution{Only if the experiment says ``uncalibrated'' at the top $\Rightarrow$ ``I'' (interactive spectrometer control) icon, click calibrated, then set parameters to spectrum, then window.}

\paragraph{if new type of sample}
Stop at second peak.

Check that modulation amplitude is $<$ 0.2 x smallest feature.

Set RG with box.

Check that resolution along $x$ is OK.

\paragraph{always}

Run actual scan.

Save ESR.
\fn{groes_120202}

For 8 scans, alarm for about 2.5 min.

Cntrl-S after scan is finished.

Hit Cntrl-A for ssh transfer and process.

    figure_list = fl)
fl.show(thisjobname()+'.pdf')
\end{lstlisting}
\end{tiny}

Put into tune mode before removing sample, and turn down power.

Run background scan.

\subsubsection{wrap up}\maxminutes{18}
Turn off field and air and flip switch.

Pull out, check and measure sample.

Copy this file into compilation for the project.

Clear + copy to protocol.

\subparagraph{Run ESR background scan}
\subparagraph{Last experiment only}
Put quartz tube in loops to right, reattach mod coil.

Replace the dewar (being sure to include both inner and outer top collets).

Find dip near 9.88~GHz (if without dewar) or 9.31~GHz (if with dewar), and autotune.

Git commit again and Git push.
