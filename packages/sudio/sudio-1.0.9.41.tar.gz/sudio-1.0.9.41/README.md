Sudio is an open-source digital audio processing library that offers advanced functionality through an intuitive interface. It supports both real-time and non-real-time audio manipulation, making it versatile for a wide range of audio applications, from simple playback to complex audio transformations.


## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

Install Sudio using pip:

```bash
pip install sudio --upgrade
```

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example to get you started with audio playback:

```python
import sudio

su = sudio.Master()
song = su.add('example.mp3')
su.echo(song[0:15, :'1000'])
```

This will play the first 15 seconds of the audio file ‚Äòexample.mp3‚Äô, filtering out frequencies below 1000 Hz, on the standard output audio stream.

## üéπ Key Features
- Handles both real-time streaming and offline processing, allowing for dynamic applications like live audio effects as well as batch processing of audio files.
- Allows integration of custom processing modules.
- Flexible audio playback, precise time-domain slicing, and Comprehensive filtering options
- Advanced audio manipulation (joining, mixing, shifting)
- Real-time audio streaming with dynamic control (pause, resume, jump)
- Custom audio processing pipelines for complex effects
- Multi-format support with quality-controlled encoding/decoding
