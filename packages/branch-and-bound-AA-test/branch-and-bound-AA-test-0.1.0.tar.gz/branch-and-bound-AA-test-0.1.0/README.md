A knapsack problem solver with branch and bound

The finction will be as:
```python
knapsack_branch_and_bound(W, items)
```
with W <- Total weight, items <- list of tuples, the have (value, weight)
Example,  W = 10 , items = [(10, 2), (5, 3), (15, 5), (7, 7), (6, 1), (18, 4), (3, 1)] gives result 39
