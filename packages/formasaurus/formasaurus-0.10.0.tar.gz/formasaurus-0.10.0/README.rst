.. description starts

Formasaurus is a Python package that tells you the type of an HTML form
and its fields using machine learning.

It can detect if a form is a login, search, registration, password recovery,
"join mailing list", contact, order form or something else, which field
is a password field and which is a search query, etc.

License is MIT.
