# Pypopipette
My take on the Dots and Squares game (Pipopipette in French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·).

Disclaimer: this is a work in progress.

## How to play
* Recommended: Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#project-setup), run `poetry install`, then run `poetry run python src/pypopipette_game/frontend.py`.
* Simpler (but could lead to dependenies issues): run `python src/pypopipette_game/frontend.py`.
