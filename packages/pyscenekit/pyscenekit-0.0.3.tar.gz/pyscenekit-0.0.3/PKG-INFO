# PySceneKit

PySceneKit is an open-source Python library designed for common scene processing and visualization tasks. Whether you're working with 2D or 3D scenes, PySceneKit provides a comprehensive toolkit to help you manipulate, analyze, and visualize your data with ease.

## Introduction

Welcome to PySceneKit! This project is fueled by my passion for scene understanding, particularly in indoor environments. Frustrated by the lack of user-friendly tools for processing images and 3D indoor scenes, I often found myself rewriting code for different datasets.

PySceneKit aims to simplify scene understanding by providing an intuitive toolkit that incorporates both state-of-the-art techniques and classic methods tailored for indoor scenes. I warmly welcome contributions from fellow enthusiasts and researchers to help make this project a valuable resource for everyone!


## Installation

```bash
conda create -n pyscenekit python=3.10 -y
conda activate pyscenekit
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e . # will support pip install pyscenekit in the future
```

## Usage

SceneKit2D is a module within PySceneKit that focuses on 2D scene processing and analysis. It provides a set of tools and algorithms for working with 2D images, particularly in the context of indoor scenes. Checkout the key features in [SceneKit2D](./SCENEKIT2D.md).

SceneKit3D is a module focusing on 3D scene processing and analysis. Checkout the key features in [SceneKit3D](./SCENEKIT3D.md).
