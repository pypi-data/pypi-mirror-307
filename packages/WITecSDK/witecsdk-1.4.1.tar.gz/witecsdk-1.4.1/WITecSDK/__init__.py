"""This package simplifies to access the COM interface of WITec Control.

It is downwards compatible with WITec Control versions older than the
current release. Ready-to-use classes are offered for most common
measurement modes.

Typical usage example:
    
    from WITecSDK import WITecSDKClass
    WITec = WITecSDKClass()
