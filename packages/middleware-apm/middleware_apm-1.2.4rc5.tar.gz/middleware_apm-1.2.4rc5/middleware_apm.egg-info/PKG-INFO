# Middleware Python APM

[Middleware](https://middleware.io/)'s APM (Application Performance Monitoring) tool is a powerful solution that empowers developers to gain valuable insights into the performance and behavior of their Python applications.

By installing the Middleware Host agent and integrating the APM package, developers can seamlessly monitor their applications and take advantage of various functionalities. The APM allows automatic collection of distributed tracing data, metrics, logs, and profiling information.

You can follow our [documentation](https://docs.middleware.io/docs/apm-configuration/python/python-apm-setup) to install the Middleware Host agent and integrate the APM package with your [Python](https://app.middleware.io/installation/apm/python) application.
