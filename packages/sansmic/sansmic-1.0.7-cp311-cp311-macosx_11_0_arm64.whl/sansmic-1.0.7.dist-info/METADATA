## SANSMIC

SANSMIC (or sansmic) is research software developed to simulate the
leaching of salt caverns.
Its primary use has been modeling the leaching for the caverns at the
U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).
SANSMIC differs from other leaching software as it implements a
simultaneous leach+fill simulation which was used in the 1980s during
the construction and original fill of the SPR Bryan Mound site. The
primary use for SANSMIC is for modeling liquid petroleum product
storage caverns that use raw water for product withdrawals, and as
a comparison point for newer salt disolution models.

All lower-case 'sansmic' is used as the repository name and remaining
documentation to differentiate this package from the older SANSMIC
program written in FORTRAN - and because all-caps feels very loud.
The sansmic package provided here is a re-write of the original program
using the C++ and Python programming languages.

### Installation
The sansmic package requires Python 3.9 or greater and at least the
numpy and pandas packages.

Installation can be accomplished most easily by using the PyPI.
It can also be installed by downloading a wheel from the [releases]
in this repository, or by cloning this repository and building it
yourself. Finally, a standalone executable has been created that
will be added to each release for Windows users that are unable
due to install Python on their corporate computers (see the releases
on the right side of the page).


#### PyPI wheels
To install a pre-compiled version of sansmic, use the pip command

    python -m pip install sansmic


#### Build from source
To download and build from source, you should clone the repository
(or, fork sansmic and clone your repository) and then install using
the editable (``-e``) flag.

    git clone https://github.com/sandialabs/sansmic.git
    cd sansmic
    python -m pip install -e .


### Usage
Once installed, you can use

    sansmic --help

and

    sansmic-convert --help

to get help on how to run sansmic commands from the command line.
For more detailed usage and API information, please see
[our documentation](https://sandialabs.github.io/sansmic/).
