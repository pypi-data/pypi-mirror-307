No crash o missign file.

Prior to this change, Odoo was crashing as soon as access to a file stored into
an external filesytem was not possible. This can lead to a complete system block.
This change prevents this kind of blockage by ignoring access error to files
stored into external system on read operations. These kind of errors are logged
into the log files for traceability.
