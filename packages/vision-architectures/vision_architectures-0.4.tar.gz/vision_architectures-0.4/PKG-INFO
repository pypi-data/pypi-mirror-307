This repository contains implementations of various architectures used in `Computer Vision`.

Most implementations that are provided alongside research papers are with keeping 2D natural images in mind. However, there are many use cases where the same architectures are desired for a 3D space, for eg. in medical imaging, video games, environment reconstruction etc. For this reason, most (but not all) of the architectures in this repository are 3D implementations of popular research papers.
