# LangChain
Building applications with LLMs through composability
Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.
**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.
Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.
## Quick Install
`pip install langchain`
or
`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`
## ü§î What is this?
Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.
This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:
**‚ùì Question Answering over specific documents**
- Documentation
- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database
**ü§ñ Agents**
- Documentation
- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha
## üìñ Documentation
Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:
- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)
- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)
- Reference (full API docs)
- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
