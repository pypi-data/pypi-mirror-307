    but weren't because the open trades' instruments were untradeable at the time. Open trades listed in this
    transaction will be closed once their respective instruments become tradeable.

        Attributes:
            id (Optional[str]): The Transaction's Identifier.
            time (Optional[str]): The date/time when the Transaction was created.
            user_id (Optional[int]): The ID of the user that initiated the creation of the Transaction.
            account_id (Optional[str]): The ID of the Account the Transaction was created for.
            batch_id (Optional[str]): The ID of the "batch" that the Transaction belongs to. Transactions in the same
                batch are applied to the Account simultaneously.
            request_id (Optional[str]): The Request ID of the request which generated the transaction.
            type (Optional[DelayedTradeClosureTransactionType]): The Type of the Transaction. Always set to
                "DELAYED_TRADE_CLOSURE" for an DelayedTradeClosureTransaction.
            reason (Optional[DelayedTradeClosureTransactionReason]): The reason for the delayed trade closure
