@dataclasses.dataclass
class LimitOrder:
    """A LimitOrder is an order that is created with a price threshold, and will only be filled by a price that is equal to
    or better than the threshold.

        Attributes:
            id (Union[Unset, str]): The Order's identifier, unique within the Order's Account.
            create_time (Union[Unset, str]): The time when the Order was created.
            state (Union[Unset, LimitOrderState]): The current state of the Order.
            client_extensions (Union[Unset, ClientExtensions]): A ClientExtensions object allows a client to attach a
                clientID, tag and comment to Orders and Trades in their Account.  Do not set, modify, or delete this field if
                your account is associated with MT4.
            type (Union[Unset, LimitOrderType]): The type of the Order. Always set to "LIMIT" for Limit Orders.
            instrument (Union[Unset, str]): The Limit Order's Instrument.
            units (Union[Unset, str]): The quantity requested to be filled by the Limit Order. A posititive number of units
                results in a long Order, and a negative number of units results in a short Order.
            price (Union[Unset, str]): The price threshold specified for the Limit Order. The Limit Order will only be
                filled by a market price that is equal to or better than this price.
            time_in_force (Union[Unset, LimitOrderTimeInForce]): The time-in-force requested for the Limit Order.
            gtd_time (Union[Unset, str]): The date/time when the Limit Order will be cancelled if its timeInForce is "GTD".
            position_fill (Union[Unset, LimitOrderPositionFill]): Specification of how Positions in the Account are modified
                when the Order is filled.
            trigger_condition (Union[Unset, LimitOrderTriggerCondition]): Specification of which price component should be
                used when determining if an Order should be triggered and filled. This allows Orders to be triggered based on
                the bid, ask, mid, default (ask for buy, bid for sell) or inverse (ask for sell, bid for buy) price depending on
                the desired behaviour. Orders are always filled using their default price component.
                This feature is only provided through the REST API. Clients who choose to specify a non-default trigger
                condition will not see it reflected in any of OANDA's proprietary or partner trading platforms, their
                transaction history or their account statements. OANDA platforms always assume that an Order's trigger condition
                is set to the default value when indicating the distance from an Order's trigger price, and will always provide
                the default trigger condition when creating or modifying an Order.
                A special restriction applies when creating a guaranteed Stop Loss Order. In this case the TriggerCondition
                value must either be "DEFAULT", or the "natural" trigger side "DEFAULT" results in. So for a Stop Loss Order for
                a long trade valid values are "DEFAULT" and "BID", and for short trades "DEFAULT" and "ASK" are valid.
            take_profit_on_fill (Union[Unset, TakeProfitDetails]): TakeProfitDetails specifies the details of a Take Profit
                Order to be created on behalf of a client. This may happen when an Order is filled that opens a Trade requiring
                a Take Profit, or when a Trade's dependent Take Profit Order is modified directly through the Trade.
            stop_loss_on_fill (Union[Unset, StopLossDetails]): StopLossDetails specifies the details of a Stop Loss Order to
                be created on behalf of a client. This may happen when an Order is filled that opens a Trade requiring a Stop
                Loss, or when a Trade's dependent Stop Loss Order is modified directly through the Trade.
            trailing_stop_loss_on_fill (Union[Unset, TrailingStopLossDetails]): TrailingStopLossDetails specifies the
                details of a Trailing Stop Loss Order to be created on behalf of a client. This may happen when an Order is
                filled that opens a Trade requiring a Trailing Stop Loss, or when a Trade's dependent Trailing Stop Loss Order
                is modified directly through the Trade.
            trade_client_extensions (Union[Unset, ClientExtensions]): A ClientExtensions object allows a client to attach a
                clientID, tag and comment to Orders and Trades in their Account.  Do not set, modify, or delete this field if
                your account is associated with MT4.
            filling_transaction_id (Union[Unset, str]): ID of the Transaction that filled this Order (only provided when the
                Order's state is FILLED)
            filled_time (Union[Unset, str]): Date/time when the Order was filled (only provided when the Order's state is
                FILLED)
            trade_opened_id (Union[Unset, str]): Trade ID of Trade opened when the Order was filled (only provided when the
                Order's state is FILLED and a Trade was opened as a result of the fill)
            trade_reduced_id (Union[Unset, str]): Trade ID of Trade reduced when the Order was filled (only provided when
                the Order's state is FILLED and a Trade was reduced as a result of the fill)
            trade_closed_i_ds (Union[Unset, List[str]]): Trade IDs of Trades closed when the Order was filled (only provided
                when the Order's state is FILLED and one or more Trades were closed as a result of the fill)
            cancelling_transaction_id (Union[Unset, str]): ID of the Transaction that cancelled the Order (only provided
                when the Order's state is CANCELLED)
            cancelled_time (Union[Unset, str]): Date/time when the Order was cancelled (only provided when the state of the
                Order is CANCELLED)
            replaces_order_id (Union[Unset, str]): The ID of the Order that was replaced by this Order (only provided if
                this Order was created as part of a cancel/replace).
            replaced_by_order_id (Union[Unset, str]): The ID of the Order that replaced this Order (only provided if this
                Order was cancelled as part of a cancel/replace)."""
