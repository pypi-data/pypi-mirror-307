# üß† TinyAGI (Preview Version)

**TinyAGI** is a modular, extensible, and lightweight framework for building Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) systems. TinyAGI allows you to create and manage AI agents, plugins, modules, and tools within a flexible, scalable architecture, supporting multiple model backends like OpenAI, Llama.cpp, Ollama, AlpacaX, and Tabitha.

**Disclaimer:** This is a **preview release** (version 0.0.2). TinyAGI is currently under active development, and this version is intended for testing, feedback, and early experimentation. Expect frequent updates and potential changes to the API.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Create a Configuration File**: Define your agent and model parameters in a JSON file.
   
   ```json
   {
     "agent": {
       "name": "TinyAGI Agent",
       "version": "0.0.2"
     },
     "model": {
       "type": "llama_cpp",
       "name": "Llama-2-7B",
       "parameters": {
         "model_path": "models/llama-2-7b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin",
         "temperature": 0.7,
         "max_tokens": 512
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Run the Agent**: Create a Python script to initialize and run the agent.

   ```python
   from TinyAGI.agent import Agent

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       agent = Agent(config_file='config/agent_config.json')
       agent.run()
   ```

3. **Interact with Your Agent**: Use the command-line interface or API to execute tasks, generate text, and more.
