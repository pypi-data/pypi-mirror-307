class LivetimingF1adapters:

    Adapter class for interacting with the F1 Livetiming API.

        """
        Initializes the LivetimingF1adapters class with the base URL for the Livetiming API.

        - header (Dict, optional): HTTP headers to send with the request (default is None).

    Retrieves data from the Livetiming F1 API, either as a stream of records or a static response.
