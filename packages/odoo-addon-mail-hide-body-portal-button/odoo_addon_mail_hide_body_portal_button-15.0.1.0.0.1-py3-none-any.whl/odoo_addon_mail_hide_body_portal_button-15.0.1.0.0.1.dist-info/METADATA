============================
Mail Hide Body Portal Button
============================

This module allows to hide the button automatically attached to the email's body which
gives access to the documents in the portal. Some of the models that attach this button
are sale.order, purchase.order and account.move.


Installation
============

To install this module, you need to:

*  Only install


Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to Settings > Technical > System Parameters
#. Add the comma separated list of models which have not to attach the portal button
   in the email body as the value for the parameter
   "mail_hide_body_portal_button.models". For example, if the button needs to be hidden
   in sale orders and purchase orders, the value for the parameter has to be as follows:
   sale.order,purchase.order

*  No usage instructions needed.


ROADMAP
=======

*  This module only applies to the button attached through the template with ID
   "mail_notification_paynow". All the models that use this template can be included in
   the list of models for which the button has to be hidden. However, if other
   templates include a button to the portal in the email body, it will not be possible
   to hide those buttons using this module.
