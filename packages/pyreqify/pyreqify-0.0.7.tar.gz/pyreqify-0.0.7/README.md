- üîç **Version Detection**: Fetches installed versions of imported modules (maps common aliases to official package names). It also gives the option to includes fetch `source python version` too.
- üìù **Requirements Generation**: Creates a `requirements.txt` file with all extracted dependencies and the current Python version.
