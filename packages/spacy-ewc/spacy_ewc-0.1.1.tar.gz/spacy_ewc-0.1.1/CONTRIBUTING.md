## Branch Naming Conventions

Please follow these branch naming conventions for clarity:

- **Bugfix branches**: `bugfix/your-bug-name`
- **Documentation branches**: `docs/your-doc-name`
- **Hotfix branches**: `hotfix/your-hotfix-name`

## Coding Guidelines

1. **Code Style**: Follow Python's PEP 8 style guide. Use `black` to format code and `flake8` for linting.
2. **Documentation**: Document all public classes, functions, and methods. Include clear docstrings following the [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
3. **Testing**: Write tests for new features or bug fixes. Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
4. **Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages. Follow this format:
   ```
   type(scope): description
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   feat(ner): add EWC penalty to NER component training
   ```

## How to Submit a Pull Request

1. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.

   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```
2. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit with a clear message.
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   ```
3. **Push to Your Fork**: Push the branch to your forked repository.
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   ```
4. **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository on GitHub and open a pull request. Describe your changes in detail.

   **Important**: Ensure the pull request is made against the `develop` branch, not `main`. PRs to `main` will be automatically rejected.
