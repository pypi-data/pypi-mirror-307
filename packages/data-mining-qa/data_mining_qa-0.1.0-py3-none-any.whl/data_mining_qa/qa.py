def sources_and_handling_missing_values():
    """Returns information on how missing values are handled in data mining."""
    return "Data sources like surveys and transactional data often have missing values. Techniques to handle missing values include mean imputation, regression imputation, and using algorithms that handle missing data natively."

def note_on_sampling():
    """Returns a note on sampling in data mining."""
    return "Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of data from a larger dataset for analysis. Techniques include random sampling, stratified sampling, and systematic sampling, which help reduce computational costs and improve efficiency."
