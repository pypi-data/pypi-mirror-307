# eatlocal

Eatlocal helps users solve [Pybites](https://pybitesplatform.com) code challenges locally. This cli tool allows you to download bites from the platform. You can display bite directions directly in the terminal. Once you have solved the bite you can use eatlocal to submit and it offers to open your default browser the corresponding bite page.
