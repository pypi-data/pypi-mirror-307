About this pip-installable distribution package
-----------------------------------------------

This pip-installable source distribution ``sagemath-msolve`` provides an interface to `msolve <https://msolve.lip6.fr/>`_, which implements computer algebra algorithms for solving polynomial systems (with rational coefficients or coefficients in a prime field).
