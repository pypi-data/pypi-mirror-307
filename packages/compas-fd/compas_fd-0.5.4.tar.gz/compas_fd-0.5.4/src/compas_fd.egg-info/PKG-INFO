# Constrained form finding using the Force Density Method

This package provides equilibrium solvers and constraints
for constrained form finding using the "force density" method.

The solvers can be used through the `compas_fd` paclage directly,
or through COMPAS FormFinder, which is a form finding tool with a GUI
combining various different form finding approaches.

## Installation

Stable releases can be installed from PyPI.

```bash
pip install compas_fd
```

To install the latest development version, do:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blockresearchgroup/compas_fd.git
cd compas_fd
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```
