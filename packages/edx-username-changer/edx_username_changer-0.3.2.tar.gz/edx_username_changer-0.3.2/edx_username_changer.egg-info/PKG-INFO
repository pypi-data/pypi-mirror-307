1) Add/Enable a feature flag (ENABLE_EDX_USERNAME_CHANGER) into your environment variables (through lms.yml or studio.yml, depending upon where you are installing the plugin)
```bash
FEATURES:
  ...
  ...
  ENABLE_EDX_USERNAME_CHANGER: true
  ...
```

## How To Use
Its usage is as simple as changing the username of a user account through django's admin panel.
Here are the steps (for clarity):

1) Install `edx-username-changer` plugin.
2) Use an admin account to `access django admin` panel.
3) Go to `Users` model and `select an account` to change its username.
4) In the account editor page change the `username` field.
5) Hit `Save` (present at the bottom-right of page).

The whole process can be done on `lms` or `studio` or on both of them.
