title: "Fluidimage: a Python framework to study flows from images"
abstract: |
  Fluid mechanics experimental studies are often based on image processing,
  with various algorithms such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) or
  Light Induced Fluorescence (LIF) used to compute velocity, vorticity, concentration
  or temperature fields. Fluidimage is a free and open-source Python framework
  to process images of fluids and analyse the resulting fields.
