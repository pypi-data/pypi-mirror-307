# ml-bodega
A system for manage machine learning experiments and their metrics, based on ports and adapters architecture.

### Warning: 
This project is under development and I may completely change It's schemas and design, for a more general one. For now it's only for support the [torchsystem](https://github.com/mapache-software/torch-system), with a model per aggregate and a criterion and optimizer per model, but the idea is to design something that works for any machine learning workflow not only neural networks.
