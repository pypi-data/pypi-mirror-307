    This package contains a trained model to detect anomalies in low altitude traffic.
    The model focus on spoofing attack, by recognizing the aircraft the type based on its ADS-B signal.
    Hence, if the aircraft pretend to be a small aircraft, but the model recognize it as a plane, it is an anomaly.
