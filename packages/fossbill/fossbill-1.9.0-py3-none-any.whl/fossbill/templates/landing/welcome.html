  <p>{% trans %}Fossbill is a minimalist tool to edit, generate and send bills to emails. It is FOSS as it is licenced under AGPL3. Its source code can be pulled <a href="https://sr.ht/~stacyharper/fossbill">here</a>.{% endtrans %}<p>
  <p>{% trans %}It is really easy to self-host an instance of Fossbill. Feels free to check the <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~stacyharper/fossbill">documentation</a> to configure it to suits your needs.{% endtrans %}</p>
  <p>{% trans %}Fossbill is free as in freedom, but this hosted instance cost 10 euros/month. This support the development of the tool, and encourage me to build new ones.{% endtrans %}</p>
