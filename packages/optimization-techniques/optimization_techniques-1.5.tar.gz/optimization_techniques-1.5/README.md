## Installation

You can install the `optimization_techniques` package directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install optimization-techniques
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can import the package and start using any of the algorithms. Here’s a general example of how to import and use a variable from this package:

```python
from programs import genetic_algorithm

# Define your objective function
print(genetic_algorithm.continuous_optimization)
print(genetic_algorithm.binary_optimization)

#It will print the full code
```
