Generated from [the Pimoroni Python Boilerplate](https://github.com/pimoroni/boilerplate-python).

The QwSTPad is a small 10-button I2C gamepad.

# Installing

We'd recommend using this library with Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm or later. It requires Python â‰¥3.7.

## Full install (recommended):

We've created an easy installation script that will install all pre-requisites and get you up and running with minimal efforts. To run it, fire up Terminal which you'll find in Menu -> Accessories -> Terminal
on your Raspberry Pi desktop, as illustrated below:

![Finding the terminal](http://get.pimoroni.com/resources/github-repo-terminal.png)

In the new terminal window type the commands exactly as it appears below (check for typos) and follow the on-screen instructions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/qwstpad-python
cd qwstpad-python
./install.sh
```

**Note** Libraries will be installed in the "pimoroni" virtual environment, you will need to activate it to run examples:

```
source ~/.virtualenvs/pimoroni/bin/activate
```

## Development:

If you want to contribute, or like living on the edge of your seat by having the latest code, you can install the development version like so:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/qwstpad-python
cd qwstpad-python
./install.sh --unstable
```

## Install stable library from PyPi and configure manually

* Set up a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv --system-site-packages $HOME/.virtualenvs/pimoroni`
* Switch to the virtual environment: `source ~/.virtualenvs/pimoroni/bin/activate`
* Install the library: `pip install qwstpad`

In some cases you may need to us `sudo` or install pip with: `sudo apt install python3-pip`.

This will not make any configuration changes, so you may also need to enable:

* i2c: `sudo raspi-config nonint do_i2c 0`


You can optionally run `sudo raspi-config` or the graphical Raspberry Pi Configuration UI to enable interfaces.
