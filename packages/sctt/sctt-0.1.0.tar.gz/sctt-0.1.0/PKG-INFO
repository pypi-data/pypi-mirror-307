# SpeedCubeTimer-TUI (sctt)

![sctt_screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02c1d3c7-8ca8-4a6d-9970-903970fb2e07)

It's a TUI speed cube timer app. It can generate scrambles, measure time and display the cube's state as a cube net. It can also be used on the Linux console. (A color that cannot be displayed may change to a different color that can be displayed.)

**It must be run as root to detect keyboard events.**
