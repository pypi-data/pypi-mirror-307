    "# INFER-SUBC\n",
    "\n",
    "Infer-subc is a Python-based segmentation packaged used to analyze fluorescence confocal microscopy images of multiple subcellular organelles, including lipid droplets, ER, peroxisomes, Golgi apparaptus, mitochondria, and lysosomes, in combination (multi-channel) or individually (single channel). The Juptyer notebooks included here detail the segmentation pipelines for these six organelles as well as a number of cellular regions, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, whole cell, and neurites vs. soma (in the case of neurons; *NOT YET IMPLIMENTED*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Infer-subc builds the foundation for the segmentation workflows applied in the Napari plugin [organelle-segmenter-plugin](https://github.com/ndcn/organelle-segmenter-plugin). The logic outlined in these notebook is the same as is implemented in the plugin. \n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks also outline how we are quantifying segmentations to understand organelle morphology, distribution, and interactions (organelle membrane contacts). \n",
    "\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "## PIPELINE OVERVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general framework for our data processing pipeline we are defining 4 steps:\n",
    "1. GOAL SETTING ‚úç\n",
    "2. DATA CREATION üî¨\n",
    "3. IMAGE PROCESSING ü©ª\n",
    "4. QUANTIFICATION üìèüìê\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "## 1. GOAL SETTING ‚úç\n",
    "The goal of infer-subc is to quantitatively analyze the organelle composition, morphology, and contacts of single cells from fluorescence confocal microscopy images. The Cohen Lab utilizes infer-subc and the organelle-segmenter-plugin packages for the analysis of [multispectral images](https://doi.org/10.1002/cpcb.46) (images with 6-9 fluorescent markers), but the pipelines are also optimized to analyze images with fewer markers/channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Biological relevance**: Membrane bound organelles are used to spaciotemporally separate incompatable reactions within the cell. They interact and respond to environmental factors to allow the cell to maintain homeostasis. By assessing the organelle signatures of single cells, we can better understand the physiological changes associated with environmental reponses or disease perturbations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Segment sub-cellular components (organelles and regions) \n",
    "In order to quantify organelle features from confocal microscopy images, we must first create segmentations of each organelle in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Quantify organelle morphometrics\n",
    "Measurements of organelle shape, size, distribution, and interactions (contacts) will be used to understand the organelle signatures of single cells.   \n",
    "\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "## 2. DATA CREATION üî¨\n",
    "This analysis is optimized for confocal microscopy images that contain one or more fluorescent organelle markers. This data could be either from running an experiment or mining a database. The analysis will use the the metadata from the image to import image properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **EXAMPLE MICROSCOPY METHOD & IMAGE PRE-PROCESSING (Multispectral Imaging):**üìöüìö\n",
    "> \n",
    "> *Sample preparation:* Cultured cells are prepared for multispectral imaging using up to nine transfectable or dye-based fluorescent markers. The cells are visualized and imaged on Zeiss LSM880 Microscope fitted with a multichannel dectector system for spectral microscopy. See more about this method [here](https://doi.org/10.1002/cpcb.46).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> *Pre-processing - Linear unmixing (only necessary for spectral images):* 32 channel spectral images are Linear Unmixed in the Zeiss ZEN software using the measured emission spectra from each individual marker to yield a multi-channel image where each channel is representative of the fluorescence from a single fluorescent marker. Channels can include: Nuclei (NU; *optional*), Lysosomes (LS), Mitochondria (MT), Golgi (GL), Peroxisomes (PO), Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), Lipid Droplet (LD), and a ‚Äúresidual‚Äù signal (an output from Linear Unmixing; *optional*).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> *Optional pre-processing step:* Deconvolution can be used to increase the resolution of the confocal image. This can be beneficial (or even necessary) when analyzing complex structures such as the endoplasmic reticulum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw data file types tested: .ome.tiff or .czi files\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "## 3. IMAGE PROCESSING ü©ª\n",
    "#### Segment sub-cellular components (organelles and cell regions)\n",
    "We have implemented a stereotyped workflow system to segment each subcellular component. The steps for each workflow include:\n",
    "  1. Extraction (select channel)\n",
    "      - Organelles: an individual channel specific to that organelle\n",
    "      - Cell regions: an individual channel specific to that organelle, or a combination of channels made into a composite image\n",
    "  2. Preprocessing (intensity rescaling, smoothing)\n",
    "  3. Core Processing (thresholding)\n",
    "      - Advanced thresholding methods from the Allen Institue for Cell Science segmentation package [aics-segmentation](https://github.com/AllenCell/aics-segmentation) were utilized\n",
    "  4. Post-processing (hole filling, size exclusion)\n",
    "  5. Labeling (instance segmentation)\n",
    "  6. Saving\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary of analysis steps (outlined in Jupyter notebooks) ‚úÖ\n",
    "In each notebook, we will enumerate the steps needed to segment the organelles, segment the cell regions, or quantify the segmentations.\n",

    "#### NOTE: PIPELINE TOOL AND DESIGN CHOICES?\n",
    "We want to leverage the Allen Cell & Structure Segmenter.  It has been wrapped as a [napari-plugin](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-allencell-segmenter) but fore the workflow we are proving out here we will want to call the `aicssegmentation` [package](https://github.com/AllenCell/aics-segmentation) directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚ÄãThe Allen Cell & Structure Segmenter \n",
    "‚ÄãThe Allen Cell & Structure Segmenter is a Python-based open source toolkit developed at the Allen Institute for Cell Science for 3D segmentation of intracellular structures in fluorescence microscope images. This toolkit brings together classic image segmentation and iterative deep learning workflows first to generate initial high-quality 3D intracellular structure segmentations and then to easily curate these results to generate the ground truths for building robust and accurate deep learning models. The toolkit takes advantage of the high replicate 3D live cell image data collected at the Allen Institute for Cell Science of over 30 endogenous fluorescently tagged human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines. Each cell line represents a different intracellular structure with one or more distinct localization patterns within undifferentiated hiPS cells and hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.
