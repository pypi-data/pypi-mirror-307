An open source framework for atmospheric model and observational column comparison.
Supported by the Atmospheric Systems Research (ASR) program of the United States Department of Energy.

The Earth Model Column Collaboratory (EMC²) is inspired from past work comparing remotely sensed zenith-pointing
measurements to climate models and their single-column model modes (SCMs)
(e.g., Bodas-Salcedo et al., 2008; Lamer et al. 2018; Swales et al. 2018).

EMC² provides an open source software framework to:

1. Represent both ARM measurements and GCM columns in the Python programming
   language building on the Atmospheric Community Toolkit (ACT, Theisen et. al. 2019)
   and leveraging the EMC² team’s success with Py-ART (Helmus and Collis 2016).
2. Scale GCM outputs (using the cloud fraction) to compare with sub-grid-scale column measurements
   using a modular sub column generator designed to run off-line on time series extracted from
   existing GCM/SCM output.
3. Enable a suite of comparisons between ARM (and other) column measurements and
   the GCM model subcolumns.

Detailed description of EMC² is provided in Silber et al. (GMD, 2022;
https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-901-2022).


Usage
-----
