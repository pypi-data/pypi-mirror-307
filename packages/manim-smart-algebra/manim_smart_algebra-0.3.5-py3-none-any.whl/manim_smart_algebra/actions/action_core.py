class SmartAction:
	"""
		Transforms SmartExpressions into other SmartExpressions,
		both as static objects and also with an animation.

		An action is defined by two main things:
		the get_output_expression method, which controls how it acts on static expressions,
		and the get_addressmap method, which controls how it acts as an animation.
		Both set attributes of the corresponding name and return them.

		It may also have a preaddress parameter/attribute which will determine the subexpression
		address at which the action is applied, and a few other attributes which may adjust some
		specifics.

		self.input_expression is set to None during __init__. It is critical that actions
		can exist prior to being given expressions, so that they can be combined together.
		When an input expression is received, this attribute is set, and the method
		.get_output_expression is called, setting self.output_expression.
		This is all that is required for static actions, no animations.

		Now, to create the animation between these expressions:

		get_addressmap is also unique to each action, and returns something like
		[
			["00", "01"],
			["01", "00", {"path_arc":PI/2}],
			[FadeIn, "1"],
			["1", FadeOut]
		]
		which contains all the expression-agnostic information about the animation.
		Often this will simply define and return this list with no computation.

		get_glyphmap combines the input_expression, output_expression, and addressmap
		to create a list like
		[
			([0,1,2], [5,6]),
			([3,4,5], [1,2,3], {"path_arc":PI/2}),
			(FadeIn, [8,9]),
			([6], FadeOut)
		]
		which tells which glyphs of the mobjects to send to which others, and how.

		get_animation then simply parses this glyphmap list to create a list of
		animations, probably to be passed to AnimationGroup, like
		[
			ReplacementTransform(A[0][0,1,2], B[0][5,6]),
			ReplacementTransform(A[0][3,4,5], B[0][1,2,3], path_arc=PI/2),
			FadeIn(B[0][8,9]),
			FadeOut(A[0][6]),
			...
		]
		or something like that, the syntax is partially made up. The ... is
		ReplacementTransforms of all the individual glyphs not mentioned in the glyphmap,
		whose lengths have to exactly match.

		Broadly speaking, that's that!
