## Why build it?

There are two main challenges in Zeeland's Python library development:

1. **Reducing Circular Dependencies**: The framework provides a structured way to manage and minimize circular dependencies between components, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to reason about.

2. **Reusable Common Logic**: As the developer of multiple Python libraries, I found myself repeatedly implementing similar patterns and utilities. Zeeland extracts these common elements into a shared infrastructure, allowing better maintenance and consistency across different frameworks and libraries.

## Features

- **Logger**: A logger framework that can record exceptions and log messages to different files based on the framework.
- **Singleton**: A singleton pattern implementation.
- **Project Metadata**: A metadata framework that can record the project's metadata and save it to the default storage path.

## Quick start

Conda package manager is recommended. Create a conda environment.

```bash
conda create -n zeeland python==3.10
```

Activate conda environment and install poetry

```bash
conda activate zeeland
pip install poetry
```

### Basic Usage

Create a metadata file in the default storage path.

```python
import json
import os

from zeeland import get_default_storage_path


def main():
    storage_path = get_default_storage_path("test")
    metadata_path = os.path.join(storage_path, "metadata.json")

    metadata = {"name": "test", "version": "1.0.0", "description": "Test metadata file"}

    with open(metadata_path, "w") as f:
        json.dump(metadata, f, indent=4)

    print(f"Created metadata file at: {metadata_path}")
    with open(metadata_path, "r") as f:
        print("Content:")
        print(json.dumps(json.load(f), indent=4))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The metadata file will be saved in the default storage path, which is `~/.zeeland/test/metadata.json`.

Singleton usage

```python
from zeeland import Singleton, singleton


@singleton()
class TestSingleton:
    pass


instance1 = TestSingleton()
instance2 = TestSingleton()

assert instance1 is instance2


class TestSingletonWithArgs(metaclass=Singleton):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value


instance1 = TestSingletonWithArgs("test1")
instance2 = TestSingletonWithArgs("test2")

assert instance1 is instance2
assert instance1.value == "test1"
```

Logger usage

```python
from zeeland import Logger

logger = Logger("test_framework")
logger.info("Hello, Zeeland!")
```

Then you can see the log file in the default storage path. In this case, it is `~/.zeeland/test_framework/logs/{current_date}.log`.

### Makefile usage

[`Makefile`](https://github.com/Undertone0809/zeeland/blob/main/Makefile) contains a lot of functions for faster development.

<details>
<summary>Install all dependencies and pre-commit hooks</summary>
<p>

Install requirements:

```bash
make install
```

Pre-commit hooks coulb be installed after `git init` via

```bash
make pre-commit-install
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Codestyle and type checks</summary>
<p>

Automatic formatting uses `ruff`.

```bash
make format
```

Codestyle checks only, without rewriting files:

```bash
make check-codestyle
```

> Note: `check-codestyle` uses `ruff` and `darglint` library

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Code security</summary>
<p>

> If this command is not selected during installation, it cannnot be used.

```bash
make check-safety
```

This command launches `Poetry` integrity checks as well as identifies security issues with `Safety` and `Bandit`.

```bash
make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Tests with coverage badges</summary>
<p>

Run `pytest`

```bash
make test
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>All linters</summary>
<p>

Of course there is a command to run all linters in one:

```bash
make lint
```

the same as:

```bash
make check-codestyle && make test && make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Docker</summary>
<p>

```bash
make docker-build
```

which is equivalent to:

```bash
make docker-build VERSION=latest
```

Remove docker image with

```bash
make docker-remove
```

More information [about docker](https://github.com/Undertone0809/python-package-template/tree/main/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/docker).

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Cleanup</summary>
<p>
Delete pycache files

```bash
make pycache-remove
```

Remove package build

```bash
make build-remove
```

Delete .DS_STORE files

```bash
make dsstore-remove
```

Remove .mypycache

```bash
make mypycache-remove
```

Or to remove all above run:

```bash
make cleanup
```
