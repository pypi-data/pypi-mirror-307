JUDGE_PROMPT = """
You will be given a question, a expected_answer, and a system_answer.
Your task is to provide a 'total rating' scoring how well the system_answer answers compared with ground truth in expected_answer in terms of factual correctness to the question.
Give your answer as a integer on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 means that the system_answer is not correct at all compared with expected_answer, and 5 means that the answer completely and correctly answers the question.
Provide your feedback as follows:
Feedback:::
Total rating: (your rating, as a int between 0 and 5)
Now here are the question, expected_answer, system_answer.
Question: {input_query}
Expected Answer: {expected_answer}
System Answer: {generated_answer}
