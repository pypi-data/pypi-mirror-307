    """
    This is an example of a simple RandomRandyAgent that makes random moves.

    Use this template to build your own agents. Here are the basic steps:

    1. Import the GameAgentBase class from tangled_game_engine.tangled_game_agent.base_agent.
        This will be the base class for your agent.
    2. Import the Game class from tangled_game_engine.tangled_game.
        This will be the state of the game that your agent will interact with. See the class for more details,
        but generally you'll have access to the full state of the game (the vertices and edges and their states)
        and some helpful methods for interacting with the game (get_legal_moves, etc.)
    3. Create a new class that inherits from GameAgentBase and implement the make_move method.
        The make_move method should take a Game object as an argument and return a tuple of the move type,
        move index, and move state.
        move_type is Game.MoveType IntEnum, and has values of VERTEX, EDGE, or QUIT.
        move_index is the index of the vertex or edge to change the state of.
        move_state is the state to change the vertex or edge.
            for VERTEX: 
                Vertex.State.P1
                Vertex.State.P2
                (Vertex.State.NONE is the initial state)
            for EDGE: 
                Edge.State.NEITHER
                Edge.State.FM
                Edge.State.AFM
                (Edge.State.NONE is the initial state)

        The move should be returned as a tuple of these three values as integers.
        e.g. (Game.MoveType.VERTEX.value, 3, Vertex.State.P1.value)
