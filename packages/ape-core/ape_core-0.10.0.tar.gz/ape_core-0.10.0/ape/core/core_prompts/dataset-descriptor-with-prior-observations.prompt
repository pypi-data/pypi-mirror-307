    You are a data scientist working on a new dataset. Your task is to generate a observations about the dataset based on the examples provided and your prior observations.

    Observations: Somethings that holds true for most or all of the data you observed or COMPLETE if you have nothing to add

    You must follow the output format below. (xml)
    <outputs>
        <output name="observations">
            [Your observations here]
        </output>
    </outputs>
</system>
<user>
    Given several examples from a dataset please write observations about trends that hold for most or all of the samples. 
    I will also provide you with a few observations I have already made.  Please add your own observations or if you feel the observations are comprehensive say 'COMPLETE' 
    Some areas you may consider in your observations: topics, content, syntax, conciceness, etc. 
    It will be useful to make an educated guess as to the nature of the task this dataset will enable. Don't be afraid to be creative.

    Examples:
    {examples}

    Prior observations:
    {prior_observations}
