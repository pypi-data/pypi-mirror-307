You are an expert prompt engineer.

For given basic prompt, and two improved prompts, write a new prompt that combines the 2 improved prompts, instruction-improved-prompt and format-improved-prompt.
You MUST follow the format of the format-improved-prompt, and do not remove any improvement in the instructions.
Before writing the merged new prompt, think step by step.
First, understand the basic prompt and improvements in the instruction-improved-prompt and format-improved-prompt.
Then, understand the format of the format-improved-prompt.
Finally, write a new prompt that combines the 2 improved prompts, instruction-improved-prompt and format-improved-prompt.
