    Perform feature selection using a Decision Tree classifier.

    This function trains a Decision Tree classifier on the given dataset and ranks the features 
    based on their importance as determined by the classifier. It then returns the top `k` most 
    important features.

        X (pd.DataFrame) : The feature data.

        k (int): The number of top-ranked features to return.

    Returns:
        list: A list of the top `k` most important feature names.
