## Usage

Install the library:

```
import bettercorrectfast as bcf

issue = bcf.create("Title", "Description", "Screenshot.png")
bcf.save(issue, "issue.bcf")
```

It is also possible to add a title, description, snapshot and/or ifc-guids to the issue:

```
issue_from_text = bcf.create("Title", "Description")

issue_from_title = bcf.create(title="Title)
issue_from_description = bcf.create(description="Description")
issue_from_image = bcf.create(image_filepath="Screenshot.jpg")
issue_from_ifc_guids = bcf.create(ifc_guids=["1rDWROW8j2v8TxahWHKI_E", "1rDWROW8j2v8TxahWHKap1"])
```


## Technical Notes

The issue schema conforms to the BCF (BIM Collaboration Format) version 2.1 standard as defined by buildingSMART International.

**Note:** This library currently supports image snapshots exclusively in .png format. Support for .jpg format is in development.
