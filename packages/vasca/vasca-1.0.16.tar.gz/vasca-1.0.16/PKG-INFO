## Motivation
VASCA (Italian for "bathtub" üõÅ) is a high-performance software package developed to
address the challenges of time-domain astronomy, especially given the increasing volume
of data from large-scale surveys such as [ZTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwicky_Transient_Facility),
[LSST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_C._Rubin_Observatory), and [ULTRASAT](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/ultrasat/).
Designed to analyze time-variable cosmic sources like active galactic nuclei, stars, and
transient events, VASCA provides a modular, scalable solution for integrating data from
multiple instruments and conducting a cohesive analysis.

## Pipeline Overview

The VASCA analysis pipeline consists of three primary steps:
1. **Spatial Clustering**: Associate detections from repeated observations to unique
cosmic sources using [mean-shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_shift) clustering.
2. **Statistical Variability Detection**: Identify time-variable sources by testing flux
variations against a constant hypothesis at a 5-œÉ significance level.
3. **Source Classification**: Classify detected sources, including cross-matching with
external catalogs (e.g., SIMBAD, Gaia).

The main output of the pipeline is a catalog of time-variable cosmic
sources, including detailed classifications and cross-matches with existing astronomical
databases.

## Key Features

- **Simplicity and Modularity**: The software uses a hierarchical data model and modular
processing to ensure scalability and ease of use. It supports data from multiple
instruments seamlessly.
- **Proven Algorithms**: VASCA relies on established algorithms and statistical methods,
ensuring robustness and reducing the maintenance burden.
- **Focus on Specific Use Case**: Optimized for analyzing time-domain astronomical data,
VASCA keeps complexity low, simplifying auditing and debugging.
- **Standards Compliance**: Outputs are designed for publication readiness by adhering to
IAU and CDS standards, using widely-accepted, non-proprietary data formats. 
- **Customization and Extensibility**: VASCA allows flexible configuration, making it
adaptable to different datasets and instrument-specific requirements.

## Proof-of-Principle Study

VASCA was applied to a proof-of-principle study  using the Galaxy Evolution Explorer
(GALEX) archive (2003-2013). This study produced a catalog of over 4,000 UV-variable
sources, revealing UV variability across all classes of stars. Notably, a massive,
pulsating white dwarf exhibited unique long-term variability in the UV. The full article
including a description of VASCA's pipeline¬†can be found here:
[The time-variable ultraviolet sky: Active galactic nuclei, stars, and white dwarfs](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...687A.313B/abstract).

## Documentation and Installation

VASCA is distributed as an open-source package. Comprehensive documentation is available
[here](https://rbuehler.github.io/vasca/), including example notebooks and an API reference to help users get started.
For quick installation, VASCA can be installed via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/vasca/) using:
```shell
pip install vasca
```
For more info see the [installation guide](docs/getting_started.md#installation).
