This window contains a display which shows the altitude over time of 
selected targets in your target list.

.. note:: This window will be blank if there are no targets selected.

===================
Highlighted regions
===================

The yellow regions at the top and bottom are the warning areas. In those 
regions observations are difficult due to high airmass or very high elevation. 
The dashed red vertical lines are the site sunset and sunrise times. The 
vertical orange region demarcates the time of Civil Twilight, the vertical 
lavender region demarcates the time of Nautical Twilight, and the vertical 
blue region demarcates the time of Astronomical Twilight. The green region 
marks the next hour from the current time. 

=====================
Setting time interval
=====================

To change the plotted time interval, press the button next to "Centered on:" 
to open a drop down menu. Three options are available, Night Center, 
Day Center, and Current. "Night Center" will center the time axis on the middle 
of the night, which can be found in the :doc:`polarsky` window. The time axis 
will extend from a little before sunset to a little after sunrise. "Day 
Center" will center the time axis on the middle of the day, and the time 
axis will extend from sunrise to sunset. "Current" will set the time axis 
to extend from about -2 to +7 hours, and will automatically adjust as time 
passes.

========================
Checking moon separation
========================

The visibility window can display the moon-object separation by pressing the 
checkbox next to "Plot moon sep" at the bottom left corner of the window. 
Selecting this option will display the separation in degrees at every hour 
while the object is above the horizon.  

============
Plot Options
============

The drop down menu by "Plot:" controls which targets are plotted on the 
visibility plot. Selecting "All" will show all of the targets, 
selecting "Tagged+Selected" will show all of the targets which have been 
tagged or are selected, and selecting "Selected" will show only the 
target which is selected.
