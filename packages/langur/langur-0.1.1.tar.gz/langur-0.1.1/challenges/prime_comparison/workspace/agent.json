Accuracy Comparison:\n- Both methods found exactly 78,498 prime numbers up to 1,000,000\n- This confirms both implementations are correct and produce identical results\n\n3. Analysis:\n- The Sieve of Eratosthenes demonstrates superior performance because:\n  * It eliminates composite numbers in bulk rather than checking each number individually\n  * It only requires one pass through the numbers to mark multiples\n  * It has a time complexity of O(n log log n)\n\n- The Trial Division method is slower because:\n  * It must check each number individually\n  * For each number, it performs division checks up to its square root\n  * It has a time complexity of O(n * \u221an)\n\n4. Trade-offs:\n- While the Sieve is faster, it requires more memory as it needs to maintain a boolean array of size n+1\n- Trial Division uses less memory but takes significantly more time to compute\n\nFor this specific test case (n=1,000,000), the Sieve of Eratosthenes is clearly the superior choice when performance is the primary concern."
