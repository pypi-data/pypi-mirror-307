```
### Initialize SMD:

Create an instance of the Master class by initializing it with the appropriate settings. This instance represents your SMD and allows you to control it.

````python
ID = 0  # Set the ID of your SMART MOTOR DRIVER
SerialPort = '/dev/ttyUSB0'  # Replace with your specific serial port ( for ex 'COM3'.)
baudrate = 115200  # Set the baud rate for serial communication

myMaster = Master(SerialPort , baudrate) #create a master object
print(master.scan()) #prints ID list of connected SMDs


from smd.red import *
import time

MASTER_PORT =  "/dev/ttyUSB0" #depending on operating system, port, etc. may vary depending on the
master = Master(MASTER_PORT) #creating master object

print(master.scan()) #prints ID list of connected SMDs

ID = master.attached()[0] #getting ID of first SMD from scanned ones.
#ID = 0 You can use directly this if it has never been changed before.
````

Configure SMD:

````python
#rpm and cpr values are depend on the motor you use.
master.set_shaft_rpm(ID, 10000) 
master.set_shaft_cpr(ID, 64)

#starts autotune for setting PID values of control algorithms
master.pid_tuner(ID)            
````
You can configure and use the **SMD**  using specific methods belonging to the master class, just like in the code above.

You can access all sample codes from [here](https://github.com/Acrome-Smart-Motor-Driver/Example-Projects).
Please read full documentation to use all features of a **SMD** 

# Firmware Update

The following methods provide users with ability to update firmware of their SMDs. To use these methods users must have an internet connection. __Users should not disconnect power from the device or it may break the device.__

  - #### `get_latest_fw_version(self)`

    **`Return:`** *Latest firmware version*

    This method gets the latest firmware version from the Github servers.

  - #### `update_fw_version(self, id: int, version='')`

    **`Return:`** *True if the firmware is updated*

    This method updates the firmware version with respect to given version string and ID.

    `id` argument is the device ID of the connected driver.

    `version` argument is the version to be updated. If version string is not given, driver is updated to the latest version available on Github.

# Control
## PID Tune and Control Parameters

The control modes on the SMD operate with PID control. Therefore, correctly tuning the P, I, and D constants is crucial for accurate control. The device features an autotune capability to automatically set these values. Alternatively, users can manually input these values if desired.

### Autotune
To utilize the autotune feature on the device, it's essential to ensure that the motor is in a freely rotatable position. This is because the card continuously rotates the motor during the autotuning process.

Following this, the next step is to input the motor's CPR (Counts Per Revolution) and RPM (Revolutions Per Minute) values into the card using the provided methods below. Failing to do this accurately may result in incorrect calculations.

  - #### `set_shaft_cpr(self, id: int, cpr: float)`

    **`Return:`** *None*

    This method sets the count per revolution (CPR) of the motor output shaft.

    `id` argument is the device ID of the connected driver.

    `cpr` argument is the CPR value of the output shaft

  - #### `set_shaft_rpm(self, id: int, rpm: float)`

    **`Return:`** *None*

    This method sets the revolution per minute (RPM) value of the output shaft at 12V rating.

    `id` argument is the device ID of the connected driver.

    `rpm` argument is the RPM value of the output shaft at 12V

After completing these steps, you should initiate the tuning process using the ``pid_tuner()`` method. Please note that immediately after calling this method, the motors will start rotating with varying speeds.

  - #### `pid_tuner(self, id: int)`

    **`Return:`** *None*

    This method starts a PID tuning process. Shaft CPR and RPM values **must** be configured beforehand. If CPR and RPM values are not configured, motors will not spin.

    `id` argument is the device ID of the connected driver.

Once the ``pid_tuner()`` method is initiated, the state of the torque (whether it's enabled or not) does not affect motor operation. There is no need to use the ``enable_torque()`` function.

#### An Example of Autotune 
```python
from smd.red import *
import time

MASTER_PORT =  "/dev/ttyUSB0" #depending on operating system, port, etc. may vary depending on the
master = Master(MASTER_PORT) #creating master object

print(master.scan()) #prints ID list of connected SMDs

ID = master.attached()[0] #getting ID of first SMD from scanned ones. You can use directly ID = 0 if it has never been changed before.

master.set_shaft_rpm(ID,10000)  #rpm and cpr values are depend on the motor you use.
master.set_shaft_cpr(ID,64)
master.pid_tuner(ID)            #starts autotune for setting PID values of control algorithms
```

### Setting PID Values
Manual input of the necessary constants for PID control is also possible. For this, separate P, I, and D constants should be configured for each control mode. Please note that each mode utilizes its own set of constants to control the motor. There are dedicated methods for configuring these constants for each control mode.

## Brushed DC Motor Controls
The SMD Red has 4 control modes:

- **PWM Control:** This mode provides power to a brushed DC motor using PWM signals.

- **Position Control:** In this mode, the brushed motor moves to the desired positions using information from the encoder.

- **Velocity Control:** This mode ensures that the motor rotates at the desired speed using data from the encoder.

- **Torque Control:** This mode allows the motor to apply a specific torque by drawing the desired current.

Except for the *PWM Control mode*, all of these control modes operate with PID control. Therefore, it is essential to configure the PID values before starting the motors in these control modes. Without proper PID tuning, the motors may not work at all or may not perform as desired. You can find the necessary information for setting PID values in the [PID Tune](#pid-tune) section of the documentation.

#### Control Methods

Regardless of which control mode you choose to use, there are two essential methods that you need to be aware of. One is the `set_operation_mode()` method, which allows you to select the motor control mode you want to use. The other is `enable_torque()`, which enables or disables the motor rotation.

- #### `set_operation_mode(self, id: int, mode: OperationMode)`

    **`Return:`** *None*

    This method sets the operation mode of the driver. Operation mode may be one of the following:
    - `OperationMode.PWM`, 
    - `OperationMode.Position`,
    - `OperationMode.Velocity`,
    - `OperationMode.Torque`.

    `id` argument is the device ID of the connected driver.

- #### `enable_torque(self, id: int, en: bool)`

    **`Return:`** *None*

    This method enables or disables power to the motor which is connected to the driver.

    `id` argument is the device ID of the connected driver.

    `en` argument is a boolean. `True` enables the torque while False `disables`.




### PWM Control
- ####  `set_duty_cycle(self, id: int, pct: float):`

    **`Return:`** *None*

    This method sets the duty cycle to the motor for PWM control mode in terms of percentage. Negative values will change the motor direction.

    `id` argument is the device ID of the driver.

    `id` argument is the duty cycle percentage.
#### An Example of PWM Control
```python
from smd.red import *


MASTER_PORT =  "COM10"
master = Master(MASTER_PORT) #creating master object
print(master.scan())
ID = 0 

master.set_operation_mode(ID, 0)    #sets the operating mode to 0 represents PWM control mode.
master.set_duty_cycle(ID, 50)       #sets the duty cycle to 50 percent
master.enable_torque(ID, True)      #enables the motor torque to start rotating
```
### Position Control
  - #### `set_position_limits(self, id: int, plmin: int, plmax: int)`

    **`Return:`** *None*

    This method sets the position limits of the motor in terms of encoder ticks. Default for min is -2,147,483,648 and for max is 2,147,483,647. The torque is disabled if the value is exceeded so a tolerence factor should be taken into consideration when setting these values.

    `id` argument is the device ID of the connected driver.

    `plmin` argument is the minimum position limit.

    `plmax` argument is the maximum position limit.

  - #### `get_position_limits(self, id: int)`

    **`Return:`** *Min and max position limits*

    This method gets the position limits of the motor in terms of encoder ticks.

    `plmax` argument is the maximum position limit.

  - ####  `set_position(self, id: int, sp: int)`

    **`Return:`** *None*

      This method sets the desired setpoint for the position control in terms of encoder ticks.

      `id` argument is the device ID of the driver.

      `sp` argument is the position control setpoint.


  - ####  `get_position(self, id: int)`

    **`Return:`** *Current position of the motor shaft*

      This method gets the current position of the motor from the driver in terms of encoder ticks.

      `id` argument is the device ID of the driver.

#### An Example of Position Control

```python
from smd.red import *

MASTER_PORT =  "COM10"
master = Master(MASTER_PORT) #creating master object
print(master.scan())
ID = 0 

master.set_shaft_rpm(ID, 10000)  #rpm and cpr values are depend on the motor you use.
master.set_shaft_cpr(ID, 64)
master.set_control_parameters_position(ID, 10, 0, 8) #SMD ID, Kp, Ki, Kd

master.set_operation_mode(ID, 1)    #sets the operating mode to 1 represents Position control mode.
master.enable_torque(ID, True)      #enables the motor torque to start rotating

while True:
    master.set_position(ID, 5000)   #sets the setpoint to 5000 encoder ticks.
    time.sleep(1.2)
    master.set_position(ID, 0)      #sets the setpoint to 0 encoder ticks. Motor goes to start
    time.sleep(1.2)

```
You should enter the PID values of Position Control Mode or just tune once the SMD at start. CPR and RPM values should be entered to SMD calculates the neseccary varaibles. If you don't then the motor cannot rotate.

from smd.red import *

MASTER_PORT =  "COM10"
master = Master(MASTER_PORT) #creating master object
print(master.scan())
ID = 0 

master.set_shaft_rpm(ID,10000)  #rpm and cpr values are depend on the motor you use.
master.set_shaft_cpr(ID,64)
master.set_control_parameters_velocity(ID,10,1,0) #SMD ID, Kp, Ki, Kd

master.set_operation_mode(ID, 2)    #sets the operating mode to 2 represents Velocity control mode.
master.set_velocity(ID, 2000)       #sets the setpoint to 2000 RPM.   

master.enable_torque(ID, True)      #enables the motor torque to start rotating
```
You should enter the PID values of Position Control Mode or just tune once the SMD at start. CPR and RPM values should be entered to SMD calculates the neseccary varaibles. If you don't then the motor cannot rotate.

```
**_You must enter the PID values of the Torque Control Mode. Since Auto tune does not produce these values, you must set them yourself._** If you do not do this, the motor cannot rotate properly.
