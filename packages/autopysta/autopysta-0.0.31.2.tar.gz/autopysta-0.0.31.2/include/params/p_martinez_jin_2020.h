 * @details This class manages the parameters for the stochastic LWR car-following model based on the work by Martinez and Jin (2020). 
 * The model introduces stochasticity in vehicle parameters, including jam density, and is specifically designed to account for heterogeneous traffic flow, 
 * such as the presence of autonomous and human-driven vehicles with different jam densities and time gaps.
