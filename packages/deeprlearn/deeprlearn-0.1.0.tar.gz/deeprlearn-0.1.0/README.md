## Quick Start

Hereâ€™s how to train a **Q-Learning** agent on the `MountainCar` environment:

```python
from deeprl.environments import GymnasiumEnvWrapper
from deeprl.agents.q_learning_agent import QLearningAgent
from deeprl.function_approximations import RBFBasisApproximator
from deeprl.reward_shaping import MountainCarRewardShaping

def main():
    
    # Initialize the environment and approximator
    env = GymnasiumEnvWrapper('MountainCar-v0')
    approximator = RBFBasisApproximator(env=env, gamma=0.5, n_components=500)
        
    agent = QLearningAgent(
        env=env,
        learning_rate=0.1,
        discount_factor=0.99,
        is_continuous=True,
        approximator=approximator,
        reward_shaping=MountainCarRewardShaping(),
        verbose=True
    )
    
    # Train the agent
    agent.learn(episodes=10000, max_steps=10000, save_train_graph=True)
    
    # Evaluate the agent
    rewards = agent.interact(episodes=10, render=True, save_test_graph=True)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Features Overview

### 1. Dynamic Programming Agents
- **ValueIterationAgent**: Uses the Value Iteration algorithm to compute the optimal policy.
- **PolicyIterationAgent**: Implements the Policy Iteration algorithm for policy optimization.

### 2. Function Approximations
Support for approximating value functions or policies using:
- **Linear Approximators**: Efficient for linearly separable problems.
- **Radial Basis Function (RBF) Approximators**: Captures non-linear patterns in continuous spaces.
- **Polynomial Approximators**: Expands features for higher-dimensional representation.
- **Neural Network Approximators**: For complex, non-linear function approximation.

### 3. Reward Shaping
Enhance learning in sparse or uninformative environments with:
- **Distance-Based Shaping**: Rewards progress toward a specific goal.
- **Potential-Based Shaping**: Ensures policy invariance while guiding exploration.
- **Step Penalty Shaping**: Penalizes excessive steps to encourage efficiency.

### 4. Integration with Gymnasium
Easily integrate with a wide range of Gymnasium environments, supporting both discrete and continuous action/state spaces.

### 5. Saving and Loading Agents
Persist agent parameters for reproducibility or testing:

```python
# Save the agent's parameters
agent.save('value_iteration_agent.pkl')

# Load the agent's parameters
agent.load('value_iteration_agent.pkl')
```
