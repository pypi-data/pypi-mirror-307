This directory contains a collection of test scripts that are executed
by "make check" and/or "make checklong". The basic setup and execution
of an individual tests looks like,

  COMMAND="the command to run"
  DESCRIPTION="a description of the test"
  EXPECTED="the expected output from $COMMAND"
  run_test

The run_test() function will then run the given $COMMAND, and report
the result; that is, whether or not the actual output matches the
$EXPECTED output. There are a few more variables you can use: the
run_test() function is defined and documented in lib/run-test.sh.

Variables
=========

A few environment variables are passed from the GNUmakefile to the
test scripts:

 * DIM: the value of POLY_Dmax to use. The "all-dims" target produces
   multiple executables, each compiled with a different value for
   POLY_Dmax. For example, poly-4d.x, poly-5d.x, ..., poly-11d.x. The
   value of $DIM tells the test script which of those executables to
   test. The GNUmakefile loops through all possible values of DIM, to
   ensure that all executables get tested. As a result, the test
   scripts themselves do not need to repeat any tests.

 * LONG: if set to a non-null value, indicates that the script
   is allowed to run tests that take a long time to run. The
   "make checklong" command sets this automatically; a plain
   "make check" does not.

Return value
============

Each script succeeds (exits with code zero) if all of its tests pass,
and fails with a non-zero code otherwise.
