# Happy Project

## Overview

`Happy` is a modular and feature-rich package boilerplate code that is
designed to solve a simple yet impactful problems .The project is designed to be highly maintainable,
extensible, and, flexible,
with a focus on clean code principles
and optimization.

`Happy` will have a lot of different extensions in the future.

## Content
The project includes multiple modules with a clear separation of concerns:

- **Log**: Provide a different logging strategies [e.g. ConsoleLogger], built on the top of loguru.
- **Collections**: Collection of helper functions and classes.
- **Toolkit**: Collection of simple yet fast functions and classes.
- **Re**: Collection of regular expressions (regex patterns) for common data validation tasks across a variety of fields.
- **Time**: Collection of time-related functions and classes.
- **Types**: Collection of types used across the project.

## Features
- **Console Logging**: Using the `ConsoleLogger` class, the application can log messages to the console for debugging
  and runtime monitoring.
- **IDE Compatibility**: The `FixIDEComplain` class prevents IDE complaints about unimplemented methods while keeping
  the codebase functional.
- **Modular Design**: The project is broken down into independent modules for easier testing, maintenance, and
  scalability.
- **High Performance**: The project uses efficient data structures and algorithms to optimize performance.
- **Type Checking**: The project uses type hints to enforce strong typing and provide better documentation.
